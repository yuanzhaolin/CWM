Here's what we found:\n\n| Warehouse          | Cotton Fabric Remaining |\n|--------------------|-------------------------|\n| Main Warehouse     | 3400                    |\n| Auxiliary Warehouse| None                    |\n\nBased on the available data, the \"Main Warehouse\" has a total of 3400 units of \"Cotton Fabric\", while the \"Auxiliary Warehouse\" doesn't have any recorded stock of this material. So, the \"Main Warehouse\" definitely has more \"Cotton Fabric\"! 🎉\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! 😊",
