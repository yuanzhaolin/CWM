    "gt": "Sure thing! Let's dive into the materials allocated for the cutting tasks assigned to the \"Expert Cutters\" group that haven't been completed yet. Here's a neat table to show you the details:\n\n| Cutting Task ID | Material Name       |\n|-----------------|---------------------|\n| 8               | Denim Fabric        |\n| 11              | Wool, Silk          |\n| 16              | Wool, Leather, Down |\n| 19              | Cotton Fabric, Synthetic Fiber |\n| 20              | Wool, Leather       |\n| 21              | Cotton Fabric, Synthetic Fiber |\n| 26              | Wool                |\n| 27              | Wool, Leather, Down |\n| 34              | Cotton Fabric, Synthetic Fiber |\n\nI hope this helps!
