    "gt": "Hello there! 😄 Let's take a look at the sewing tasks for the orders placed by PolyU in January. Here's what I found:\n\n| Order Product ID | Sewing Task Status |\n|------------------|--------------------|\n| 1                | Completed          |\n| 2                | In Progress        |\n| 3                | In Progress        |\n| 4                | In Progress        |\n| 5                | In Progress        |\n\nIt seems that not all sewing tasks have been completed yet. Only the task for Order Product ID 1 is finished, while the others are still in progress. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! 😊",
