Let's take a look at what we have:\n\n| Task ID | Planned Quantity | Status |\n|---------|------------------|--------|\n| 34      | 330              | Update Error: Can't specify target table for update in FROM clause |\n\nIt seems like there was an error when trying to update the completed quantity. The planned quantity for the task is 330, but the update didn't go through due to a technical issue. You might want to try a different approach to update the completed quantity. If you need any help with that, feel free to ask! 😊",
