    "hint": "To avoid the simultaneous occurrence of update and select in the same SQL statement, a step-by-step query can be used to organize the select query results into a fixed update statement",
    "gt": "Hey there! 😄 It looks like you've completed all the work for the sewing task with ID 34. Let's update the completed quantity based on the planned number. Here's a quick summary of what we found:\n\n| Task ID | Planned Number |\n|---------|----------------|\n| 34      | 330            |\n\nTo update the completed quantity, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Retrieve the Planned Number**: You've already done this with the query to get the planned number, which is 330.\n\n2. **Update the Completed Quantity**: Now, you can use this information to form an `UPDATE` SQL statement. Here's an example of what that might look like:\n\n   ```sql\n   UPDATE sewing_tasks SET completed_quantity = 330 WHERE id = 34;\n   ```\n\n3. **Record the Update**: It's a good idea to log this update in a JSON file for future reference. Here's a simple JSON entry you could use:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"task_id\": 34,\n     \"completed_quantity\": 330,\n     \"timestamp\": \"2023-10-05T12:34:56Z\"\n   }\n   ```\n\nFeel free to reach out if you need more help! 😊",
