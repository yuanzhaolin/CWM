  "thought": "To determine the production progress of the Dress ordered by Emily, we need to follow these steps: 1) Identify the customer ID for Emily from the customers table. 2) Find the order ID for the 'Dress' order created by Emily from the orders table. 3) Using the order ID, get the associated products (specifically the Dress) and their corresponding order_product IDs from the order_product table. 4) Find the total planned quantity and completed quantity of both cutting and sewing tasks for these order_product IDs. 5) Calculate the progress percentage based on the total completed quantity and total planned quantity. To get a comprehensive result, both cutting and sewing tasks need to be considered together.",
