Identify the order products related to orders created in June 2024.\n2. Join these order products with their corresponding cutting and sewing tasks to get the raw material allocations.\n3. Summarize the allocated quantities of raw materials for the identified orders.\n4. Retrieve the raw material names and compute the total quantities.\n\nFinally, execute the SQL to achieve this result.",
