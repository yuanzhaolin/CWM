  "thought": "To determine which workgroup has the highest remaining workload for started-but-not-completed sewing tasks, we need to calculate the total remaining workload for each workgroup and then identify the one with the highest value. The remaining workload for each sewing task is determined by subtracting the completed number from the planned number. We'll aggregate this workload by workgroup and then sort to find the one with the highest remaining workload.",

  "answer": "To determine which workgroup has the highest remaining workload for all sewing tasks that have been started but not yet completed, the provided SQL query is crucial. The query identifies the workgroup with the highest remaining workload by calculating the sum of the remaining tasks (i.e., planned tasks minus completed tasks) for each workgroup and then sorting these sums in descending order. The top record (LIMIT 1) represents the workgroup with the highest remaining workload.\n\nSQL Query:\n```sql\nSELECT working_group.id, working_group.name, SUM(sewing_tasks.planned_number - sewing_tasks.completed_number) AS remaining_workload \nFROM sewing_tasks \nJOIN working_group ON sewing_tasks.working_group_id = working_group.id \nWHERE sewing_tasks.is_started = TRUE AND sewing_tasks.completed_number < sewing_tasks.planned_number \nGROUP BY working_group.id \nORDER BY remaining_workload DESC \nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nUnfortunately, based on the contextual data provided, there is no specific information on which workgroup currently has the highest remaining workload. The data you need to answer this question is not included in the provided dataset.\n\nTo get the answer, you would need to execute this SQL query on your database. The query will provide the workgroup that has the highest remaining workload for started but uncompleted sewing tasks.",
