  "thought": "To determine which customer orders have cutting tasks assigned to the 'Advanced Cutting Group' that are not yet completed, we need to follow these steps: First, identify the ID of the 'Advanced Cutting Group' from the `working_group` table. Next, join the `cutting_tasks` table with this group ID to filter out tasks that have not been completed. Then, join the filtered cutting tasks with the `order_product` table to get the associated orders. Join the resulting set with the `orders` table to get the customer ID and order details. Last, join with the `customers` table to get the customer details.",
