  "q_en": "Please store 100 units of product p15 in the auxiliary warehouse.",
  "thought": "To store 100 units of product `p15` in the auxiliary warehouse, I need to first identify the auxiliary warehouse's ID. Assuming we know the auxiliary warehouse's ID (let's say it's `w2`), I then need to update the `warehouse_product` table to insert or update the inventory of product `p15` in the warehouse with ID `w2`. If an entry for this product in this warehouse doesn't exist, a new row should be inserted. If it already exists, the `left_number` should be updated accordingly.",

      "command": "INSERT INTO `warehouse_product` (`id`, `warehouse_id`, `product_id`, `left_number`) VALUES (UUID(), 'w2', 'p15', 100) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE `left_number` = `left_number` + 100;",

  "answer": "To store 100 units of product p15 in the auxiliary warehouse, you can use the following SQL query:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `warehouse_product` (`id`, `warehouse_id`, `product_id`, `left_number`) \nVALUES (UUID(), 'w2', 'p15', 100) \nON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE `left_number` = `left_number` + 100;\n```\n\nThis query will insert 100 units of product p15 into the warehouse with ID 'w2'. If an entry with the same `warehouse_id` and `product_id` already exists, it will update the `left_number` to add 100 units to the existing quantity.",
