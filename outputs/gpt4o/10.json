Identify Michael's `customer_id` from the `customers` table. \n2. Find the `order_id` for Michael's 'SweaterAndShorts' order from the `orders` table. \n3. Retrieve all products associated with this order in the `order_product` table. \n4. Check the `cutting_tasks` and `sewing_tasks` tables to see which products have not been completely manufactured. \n5. Combine the information to list the types and quantities of unfinished products.",
