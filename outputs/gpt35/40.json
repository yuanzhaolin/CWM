The resulting data does not provide direct information about the product types, but it does give details about the cutting tasks associated with different products.\n\nTo determine which cutting tasks are for products categorized as T-shirt, we need to first identify the order_product_id for T-shirts from the database. Then, we can match these order_product_ids with the cutting tasks to find the relevant tasks.\n\nUnfortunately, based on the provided data alone, we cannot directly identify which cutting tasks are for products categorized as T-shirt. Additional information, such as the order_product_id associated with T-shirts or a direct link between cutting tasks and product types, would be needed for a more specific answer."}
