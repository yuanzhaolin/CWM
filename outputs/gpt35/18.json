  "thought": "To find cutting tasks that use Cotton Fabric, we need to join the necessary tables: cutting_tasks, order_product, products, and materials. We will use INNER JOIN to connect these tables based on the required columns (cutting_tasks.order_product_id, order_product.product_id, products.id, products.attributes, and materials.name). Then, we will filter the results where the material name is 'Cotton Fabric'.",

The query filters the materials based on the name 'Cotton Fabric'. However, the query did not return any results. This could indicate that there are currently no cutting tasks in the database that use Cotton Fabric, or there may be an issue with the data or query logic.",
