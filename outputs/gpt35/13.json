  "thought": "To retrieve the raw materials with non-zero inventory in all warehouses, we need to join the 'materials' table with the 'warehouse_material' table on 'material_id'. We will then filter the results by checking for 'left_number' greater than 0 in all warehouses. Finally, we will group the results by 'type' and sum the 'left_number' to get the remaining quantity.",

  "answer": "Based on the data retrieved from the database, the SQL query you provided, and the question asked, it appears that there are no raw materials with a non-zero inventory in all of the warehouses at the moment.\n\nThe query you provided groups the materials by type and sums up the remaining quantities from each warehouse. However, based on the retrieved data where 'Remaining Quantity' is `None` for both 'wip' and 'origin' types, it indicates that these materials have zero inventory across all warehouses.\n\nTherefore, as of the current database records, there are no raw materials with a non-zero inventory in all of our warehouses for the 'wip' and 'origin' types.",
