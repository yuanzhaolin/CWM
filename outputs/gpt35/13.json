However, the data retrieved shows that there are no raw materials with non-zero inventory in any of the warehouses, as both 'wip' and 'origin' material types have a 'Remaining Quantity' of None. This indicates that there are no raw materials currently in stock with a quantity greater than 0 in any warehouse."}
