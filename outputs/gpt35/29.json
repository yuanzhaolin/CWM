However, the data retrieved based on user questions in the given context is empty, so there is no specific workgroup mentioned at this time. \n\nTo determine the workgroup with the highest remaining workload, you would need to execute the SQL query provided against the database that holds the sewing tasks information. The query calculates the remaining workload for each working group that has started tasks but has not completed them, and then orders the results by remaining workload to identify the workgroup with the highest remaining workload.",
