  "thought": "To retrieve the raw materials and quantities used for orders in June 2024, we need to join the necessary tables (orders, order_product, cutting_tasks, cutting_material_allocation, materials) based on their relationships. We also need to filter the data based on the orders created in June 2024. Finally, we will sum up the allocated quantities of raw materials for each order and organize the data into the requested form.",

The query is designed to retrieve the remaining quantity of raw materials allocated for cutting tasks in June 2024, but since the data returned is empty, it indicates that there were no relevant records found based on the specified conditions.\n\nIf you would like to obtain information on raw materials and quantities used for orders in June 2024, you may need to check the data availability in the database or adjust the query parameters to ensure it captures the desired information accurately. Additionally, verifying that the data exists for the given timeframe and conditions specified in the query is essential for obtaining the required results.",
