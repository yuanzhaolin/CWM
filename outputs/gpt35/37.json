However, based on the data retrieved from the database, there are no tasks that meet these criteria as the result returned an empty array ([]).\n\nTherefore, at the moment, there are no cutting tasks that have not been completed and have an end date before June 2024 to determine the task with the highest planned quantity. It seems that all such tasks may have either been completed, do not have an end date before June 2024, or have a planned quantity below the limit specified in the query."}
