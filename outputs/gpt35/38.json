  "thought": "To retrieve the customer orders for cutting tasks that the 'Advanced Cutting Group' has not yet completed, we need to perform a SELECT query joining the 'orders', 'order_product', 'cutting_tasks', and 'working_group' tables. We will filter the results based on the working group name, task completion status, and task type. We will also ensure that the cutting task is associated with the corresponding order product.",

  "answer": "Based on the SQL query provided in the context, the query was intended to retrieve the user IDs of customers whose orders have cutting tasks that the 'Advanced Cutting Group' has not yet completed. However, based on the data retrieved from the database, it seems that there are no customers with such pending cutting tasks at the moment. This could be due to the fact that either all cutting tasks for the 'Advanced Cutting Group' have been completed or there was an issue with the data retrieval process. It is advisable to verify the data in the database or rerun the query to ensure the accuracy of the information.",
