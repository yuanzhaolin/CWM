  "thought": "To find out which customer orders are associated with cutting tasks that the 'Advanced Cutting Group' has not yet completed, we need to join the 'cutting_tasks' table with the 'order_product' table to get the order ID, then join the 'order_product' table with the 'orders' table to get the customer ID. Finally, we filter out the results where the cutting task is not completed and the working group is the 'Advanced Cutting Group'.",
