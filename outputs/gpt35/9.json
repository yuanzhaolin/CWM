We will join the 'sewing_tasks' table with the 'working_group' table on the 'working_group_id' to filter tasks related to William. Then, we will group by the 'order_product_id' to calculate the total planned and completed numbers.",

  "answer": "Based on the SQL query provided, the query is designed to retrieve data regarding the progress of sewing tasks for William specifically. However, based on the data retrieved from the database, which is an empty set \"[]\", there is no progress information available for sewing tasks related to William at the moment. This could indicate that there are no sewing tasks assigned to William in the database or that there are no completed tasks yet."
