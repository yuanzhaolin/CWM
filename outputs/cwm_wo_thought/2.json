    "gt": "Hello there! 😄 Let's take a look at John's orders and see if they've all been completed.\n\nBased on the information we have, here's a summary of the order statuses:\n\n| Order ID | Total Quantity | Completed Quantity | Status        |\n|----------|----------------|--------------------|---------------|\n| 2        | 435            | 435                | Completed     |\n| 10       | 150            | 0                  | Not Completed |\n\nSo, it seems that not all of John's orders have been completed. Order ID 2 is all done, but Order ID 10 still needs some work. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! 😊",
