    "gt": "Sure thing! Let's dive into the details of the sewing tasks completed by the \"Master Sewers\" group that were created after February 1, 2024. 🎉\n\nBased on the SQL query results, we have identified the working group ID for \"Master Sewers\" as **2**. However, it seems like we don't have the specific data on the sewing tasks themselves in the provided results. \n\nTo find the tasks you're interested in, you would typically need to run a query that looks something like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT task_name, creation_date \nFROM sewing_tasks \nWHERE working_group_id = 2 AND creation_date > '2024-02-01';\n```\n\nThis query would give you a list of tasks along with their creation dates. If you have access to the database, you might want to try running a similar query to get the detailed information. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask! 😊",
