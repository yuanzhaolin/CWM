    "gt": "Hello there! 😄 Let's take a look at John's orders and see if they've all been completed.\n\nHere's a summary of the order status:\n\n| Order ID | Total Quantity | Completed Quantity | Status       |\n|----------|----------------|--------------------|--------------|\n| 2        | 435            | 435                | Completed ✅ |\n| 10       | 150            | 0                  | Not Completed ❌ |\n\nSo, it seems that not all of John's orders have been completed. Order ID 2 is all done, but Order ID 10 still needs some work. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! 😊",
