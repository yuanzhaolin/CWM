    "gt": "Sure! Let's dive into the production progress of the dresses ordered by Emily. üéâ\n\nBased on the data, here's a breakdown of the production progress:\n\n| Order Product ID | Total Number of Dresses | Completed Dresses |\n|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|\n| 11               | 140                     |                   |\n| 12               | 150                     |                   |\n| 13               | 130                     |                   |\n| 14               | 120                     |                   |\n| **Total**        | **540**                 | **460**           |\n\nTo calculate the production progress in percentage, we use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Progress (\\%)} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Completed Dresses}}{\\text{Total Number of Dresses}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nSo, the production progress is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Progress (\\%)} = \\left( \\frac{460}{540} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 85.19\\% \\]\n\nEmily's dresses are about 85.19% complete!
