54.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the task. Instead of providing the progress percentage for each sewing group, it provided the progress percentage for individual sewing tasks. The original question asked for the overall progress percentage of each sewing group, not the individual tasks within those groups.
49.json;False; Wrong understanding; The model misunderstood the task. Instead of updating the completed quantity for the sewing task with ID 34, it performed an unrelated update on products with attributes 'Brown' associated with the working group 'PolyU_Skirt'.
29.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified the workgroup with the highest remaining workload and provided the correct remaining workload value.
18.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the original question. Instead of identifying cutting tasks that use "Cotton Fabric," it attempted to find working groups named "Expert Cutters" using "Cotton Fabric," which was not the requirement. This led to an incorrect query and result.
6.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer contains incorrect attribute information for some products. For example, Product ID 19 should have the attribute "Blue, L size" instead of "Green, M size", and Product ID 3 should have "White, XL size" instead of "Blue, L size". The model's process of generating the answer also reflects this incorrect mapping of attributes to product IDs.
42.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's response incorrectly focuses on updating the status for 'Skilled Sewers' working groups, which is not mentioned in the original task. Additionally, the SQL query in the tested model's process attempts to create a table instead of updating the status, which is not aligned with the task requirements. The conclusion about updating the status is also incorrect as it does not match the standard answer's conclusion.
40.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional details in its response, but it included all the necessary information from the standard answer.
19.json;True;; The tested model's answer includes the correct sewing tasks that use Silk, and it provides additional details such as Working Group ID, Order Product ID, Planned Number, Completed Number, and Status. The answer is correct, and the additional information does not contradict the standard answer.
52.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the task by focusing only on a specific material, "Cotton Fabric," instead of listing all raw materials and their quantities used for orders in June 2024. The SQL query and the resulting answer do not align with the original question's requirements.
36.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the original question. Instead of retrieving the cutting tasks for the customer "PolyU," it attempted to find working groups named "Expert Cutters" associated with "PolyU," which was not the requirement. This led to an incorrect SQL query and an incorrect answer.
16.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the original question, which asked for cutting tasks starting after May 1, 2024, not specifically for the working group named 'Expert Cutters'. The model incorrectly focused on a specific working group rather than providing a list of all cutting tasks that meet the criteria.
15.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the task. Instead of identifying the material with the lowest remaining inventory, it incorrectly checked for the total number of products in stock and concluded that no products are in stock, which does not address the original question.
37.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the original question by focusing on tasks within the 'Expert Cutters' working group, which was not specified in the original question. The original question asked for the task with the highest planned quantity among all cutting tasks, not limited to a specific working group. Additionally, the model incorrectly identified Task ID 16 as having the highest planned quantity, whereas the correct tasks were Task ID 5 and Task ID 31, both with a planned quantity of 260.
20.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
39.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided the correct cutting tasks that use "Leather" and the SQL query used to generate the answer is also correct. The format of the answer is slightly different, but it contains all the necessary information.
35.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model provided a table with allocation details including allocation ID, warehouse material ID, allocated number, and allocation status, which was not requested. The original question asked for a list of materials allocated for cutting tasks, organized by cutting task, not detailed allocation information. The model misunderstood the request, leading to an incorrect response format.
25.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer includes tasks that were not completed (status not equal to 2) and uses the 'end_time' instead of 'start_time' to filter tasks created after February 1, 2024. The standard answer correctly identifies that there are no completed tasks created after this date.
28.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model incorrectly concluded that all sewing tasks were completed based on the SQL query results. The SQL query result shows only one task, which is misleading because the standard answer indicates multiple tasks with only one completed. The model's logic in determining the completion status of all tasks is flawed.
50.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the task. It updated the completion date for the 'Expert Cutters' working group instead of specifically for cutting task 33. The original question was about extending the date for a specific task, not a working group.
9.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the original question, which asked for the progress of sewing tasks for William, not specifically for the 'Skilled Sewers' working group. The model's response focused on the progress of a specific working group rather than the overall progress of William's sewing tasks, leading to a different interpretation and answer than the standard one.
23.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified that the Main Warehouse has more Cotton Fabric, with a total of 3500 units, and the SQL query used was appropriate to obtain this result.
38.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified that there are no pending customer orders for the "Advanced Cutters" group, matching the conclusion of the standard answer.
5.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
1.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional information (Created At) which is acceptable as it does not contradict the standard answer.
14.json;False; Wrong syntax; The SQL query used by the tested model contains a syntax error. The query attempts to use an aggregate function without a GROUP BY clause, resulting in an error message.
27.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model included task ID 25 in the list of incomplete tasks, even though the completed number matches the planned number, indicating it is completed. The standard answer correctly excludes this task.
51.json;False; Wrong syntax; The model's SQL query resulted in an error due to an unknown column 'op.completed_number', which indicates a syntax or schema error in the query.
32.json;False; Information Deviation; The tested model's answer includes the "Working Group ID" instead of the "Working Group Name," which deviates from the standard answer. The standard answer provides the names of the working groups, which is more informative and aligns with the expected output.
8.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the task. Instead of providing a breakdown of the original materials used in Olivia's order, it provided a summary of materials from the warehouse, which does not match the expected output. The model's SQL query focused on retrieving warehouse materials rather than the specific materials used in Olivia's order.
34.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided the correct task ID and relevant details, even though it included additional information compared to the standard answer.
31.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer does not match the standard answer in terms of the status representation. The standard answer uses descriptive status labels ("Completed âœ…", "In Progress ðŸ”„", "Not Started ðŸš§"), while the tested model uses numerical status codes (1, 0). The conclusion about the tasks is correct, but the representation of the status is not aligned with the standard answer.
7.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer states that there are 2 orders in total for PolyU, which contradicts the standard answer that states there are 3 orders. The process of generating the answer also shows that the model retrieved a count of 2 orders, which is inconsistent with the standard answer's conclusion.
21.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer includes a discrepancy in the "Completed Number" for Task ID 22, which should be 115 as per the standard answer, but the model lists it as 60. This indicates a deviation in the logical process of interpreting the SQL query results.
24.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the task by searching for sewing tasks based on the customer name 'Elite Sewers' instead of the working group name. This led to an incorrect SQL query and the conclusion that no tasks were found, which contradicts the standard answer.
11.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the original question, which asked for all cutting tasks completed before April 30, 2024, regardless of the working group. Instead, it filtered tasks specifically for the 'Expert Cutters' working group, which was not part of the original query requirement.
45.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully updated the data and provided a response indicating the release of 100 units of Cotton Fabric from the Main Warehouse.
47.json;False; Wrong syntax; The SQL query in the tested model's process did not successfully create any cutting tasks, as indicated by the result showing 'auto_increment_id': None. This suggests an issue in the SQL query execution, leading to no tasks being generated.
13.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer does not match the standard answer. The model incorrectly aggregated the remaining quantities by material type ('wip' and 'origin') instead of listing individual raw materials with non-zero inventory. The logic used in the SQL query was incorrect, leading to a different conclusion than the standard answer.
30.json;False; Wrong syntax; The SQL query in the tested model's answer generation process contains a syntax error. The error message indicates that the query is attempting to select a non-aggregated column without a GROUP BY clause, which is incompatible with the SQL mode settings. This resulted in the model providing an incorrect answer.
3.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the original question. Instead of calculating the production progress of the dresses ordered by Emily, it attempted to find the total number of products in a warehouse, which is irrelevant to the question.
48.json;False; Wrong syntax; The tested model's SQL query contains a syntax error, specifically an unknown column 'wg.customer_id', which results in a failure to execute the query.
12.json;False; Wrong syntax; The tested model executed an incorrect SQL query unrelated to the original question, leading to no results found. The query was about products in a warehouse, not sewing tasks before May 31, 2024.
4.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer does not match the standard answer. The model provided product IDs and attributes but did not include the product names or quantities, which are essential parts of the standard answer. Additionally, the model's SQL query did not retrieve the necessary product details such as product names and quantities, leading to an incomplete answer.
17.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the original question, which asked for sewing tasks after June 1, 2024, not on June 1, 2024. As a result, it queried for tasks on the wrong date and returned no results.
41.json;False; Wrong syntax; The tested model's SQL query resulted in an error: "(1048, 'Column \'product_id\' cannot be null')", indicating a failure in retrieving the correct product IDs for the specified attributes, leading to an unsuccessful order creation.
26.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer does not match the standard answer in terms of the logical reasoning process. The standard answer provides a detailed breakdown of work-in-progress materials and their corresponding original materials with quantities, while the tested model only lists material names without any reference to quantities or work-in-progress materials.
46.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model incorrectly allocated materials to the "Expert Cutters" working group instead of directly to the cutting task with ID 19, as specified in the original question. The allocation should have been made directly to the task, not through a working group.
53.json;False; Wrong calculation; The tested model incorrectly calculated the total number of unfinished tasks as 22, whereas the correct total is 27. The model's SQL query and result processing did not correctly filter and count the tasks that are unfinished.
22.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer only includes two specific groups, "Expert Cutters" and "Elite Sewers", instead of listing all the sewing and cutting groups as required by the original question. The SQL query used by the tested model is also incorrect as it filters by specific names rather than retrieving all relevant groups.
43.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's response involves updating existing records in the database, which differs from the standard answer's approach of inserting a new entry. The standard answer ensures that existing records remain unchanged, while the tested model's approach modifies them.
10.json;False; Wrong syntax; The model's SQL query resulted in an error due to an unknown column 'op.completed_number' in the WHERE clause, leading to a failure in retrieving the necessary data for the answer.
33.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided the correct cutting tasks assigned to the "Precision Cutters" working group, and the SQL query used to retrieve the data was accurate. The format of the answer is slightly different from the standard answer, but it contains all the necessary information.
2.json;False; Wrong syntax; The model's SQL query resulted in an error due to an "Unknown column 'ot.status' in 'field list'" issue, indicating a syntax error in the SQL query.
55.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer does not align with the standard answer's logic and result. The standard answer focuses on the total number of individual products made, while the tested model incorrectly aggregates by product type and counts occurrences, leading to a different and incorrect result.
44.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully updated the quantity of the product in the warehouse using a valid SQL query, and the final result matches the intended operation.
