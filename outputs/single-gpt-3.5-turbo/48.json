Let me help you with that!\n\nUnfortunately, there seems to be an issue with the SQL query provided, as it mentions an unknown column 'wg.customer_id'. This might be causing the query to not execute as expected. \n\nLet's try to troubleshoot this together and come up with a solution. Feel free to provide more details or ask any questions you may have! 👍",
