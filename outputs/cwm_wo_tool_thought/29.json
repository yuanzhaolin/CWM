    "gt": "Hey there! 😄 Based on the data, the workgroup with the highest remaining workload for all sewing tasks that have been started but not yet completed is the **Master Sewers**. Here's a quick summary of the remaining workloads for each workgroup:\n\n| Workgroup Name   | Remaining Workload |\n|------------------|--------------------|\n| Master Sewers    | 40                 |\n| Skilled Sewers   | 0                  |\n| Advanced Sewers  | 0                  |\n| Premier Sewers   | 0                  |\n| Elite Sewers     | 0                  |\n\nIt looks like the Master Sewers have a bit more to finish up compared to the others. Keep up the great work, Master Sewers! 💪🧵",
