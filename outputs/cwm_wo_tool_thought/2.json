Here's what we found:\n\n| Order Product ID | Total Number of Products | Total Completed |\n|------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|\n| 6                | 95                       | 95              |\n| 7                | 110                      | 110             |\n| 8                | 50                       | 50              |\n| 9                | 80                       | 80              |\n| 10               | 100                      | 100             |\n| 32               | 150                      | 0               |\n\nIt seems like most of John's orders are completed, but there's one order (Order Product ID 32) that hasn't been completed yet. 😅 So, not all of John's orders are completed.
