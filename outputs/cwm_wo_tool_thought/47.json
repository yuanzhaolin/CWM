    "gt": "Hey there! 😄 It looks like we ran into a little hiccup while trying to create the cutting task. Here's what happened:\n\n| **Step** | **Description** | **Result** |\n|----------|-----------------|------------|\n| 1️⃣ | Retrieve the customer ID for \"PolyU\" | Customer ID: 1 |\n| 2️⃣ | Get the latest order ID for \"PolyU\" | Order ID: 13 |\n| 3️⃣ | Fetch any product ID from the latest order | Product ID: 1 |\n| 4️⃣ | Find the working group ID for \"Expert Cutters\" | Working Group ID: 4 |\n| 5️⃣ | Attempt to insert a new cutting task | Error: Field 'produced_wip_id' doesn't have a default value |\n\nIt seems like there's an issue with a missing default value for the 'produced_wip_id' field when trying to create the task. You might want to check that field in your database setup. Once that's sorted, we should be able to create the task without a hitch! 🚀\n\nIf you need any more help, feel free to ask! 😊",
