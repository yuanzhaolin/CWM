    "hint": "When invoking the tool tool_find_order_details to retrieve the product details of the latest order, you need to obtain the order_product_id (the primary key of this record, marked as id in the SQL result), product_id (the product's ID), and number (the quantity needed for the product). Next, for all products, use the tool tool_get_wip_materials with the given product_id to determine the required WIP material IDs and quantities. Multiply the quantity of WIP by the quantity of the product to get the total WIP needed. Finally, when inserting into the cutting_tasks table, you need to provide the order_product_id, product_id, and planned_number.",
