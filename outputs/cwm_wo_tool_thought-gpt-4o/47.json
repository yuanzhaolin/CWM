The system encountered an error because a required field, `produced_wip_id`, didn't have a default value. \n\nHere's a quick summary of what we were working on:\n\n| Task Details | Information |\n|--------------|-------------|\n| **Customer** | PolyU |\n| **Order ID** | 9 |\n| **Product ID** | 15 |\n| **Cutting Team** | Expert Cutters |\n| **Task Period** | June 30, 2024 - July 12, 2024 |\n| **Planned Number** | 3.05 |\n\nUnfortunately, we couldn't generate the cutting task IDs due to the error. You might want to check the database schema to ensure all necessary fields have default values or are provided during the task creation. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask! 😊",
