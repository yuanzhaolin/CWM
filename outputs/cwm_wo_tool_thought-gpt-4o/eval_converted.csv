1.json,False,Wrong COT,"The tested model's answer is missing the ""Order ID"" column, which is present in the standard answer. The process of generating the answer also does not include retrieving the ""Order ID"" from the SQL query results, leading to an incomplete response."
2.json,False,Wrong COT,"The tested model's answer incorrectly states that Order ID 2 is completed, while the standard answer shows that there are still incomplete tasks for Order ID 2. The tested model's logic for determining order completion is flawed, as it only considers sewing tasks and not cutting tasks, leading to an incorrect conclusion."
3.json,False,Wrong COT,"The tested model's answer provides an overall production progress percentage for all dresses ordered by Emily, rather than breaking down the progress for each sewing task as in the standard answer. The standard answer provides a detailed breakdown of progress for each task, which is not reflected in the tested model's response."
4.json,True,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully retrieved the correct product details and quantities for James's orders, matching the standard answer."
5.json,True,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
6.json,False,Wrong understanding,"The tested model misunderstood the original question by looking for an order named ""James_WinterOrder"" instead of retrieving orders for PolyU in January 2024. This led to incorrect SQL queries and ultimately no results found."
7.json,True,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
8.json,False,Wrong COT,"The tested model's answer does not match the standard answer. The model provided a list of material names and quantities that do not correspond to the original materials used in Olivia's order as specified in the standard answer. The process of generating the answer also deviated from the correct logic, as it did not retrieve the original materials for each work-in-progress material, which is necessary to provide the correct breakdown."
9.json,False,Wrong COT,"The tested model's answer provides a summary of the total quantity ordered and completed, along with a calculated progress percentage, which deviates from the standard answer's detailed task-by-task status. The standard answer lists each task with its planned and completed numbers, while the tested model aggregates these into a single progress percentage, which does not align with the expected detailed breakdown."
10.json,True,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
11.json,False,Wrong COT,"The tested model included tasks with status 1 (incomplete) in its response, whereas the standard answer only includes tasks with status 2 (completed). The SQL query used by the tested model did not filter tasks by status, leading to the inclusion of incorrect tasks in the final answer."
12.json,True,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional details (Order Product Quantity, Product Attributes, Product Type) which are not required by the original question but do not contradict the requested information. The core information about the sewing tasks completed before May 31, 2024, is accurate."
13.json,True,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model's response matches the standard answer in terms of content and format, and the SQL query used to generate the answer is appropriate and yields the correct results."
14.json,False,Wrong COT,"The tested model's answer does not include the total remaining inventory, which is a key part of the standard answer. Additionally, the SQL query used by the tested model does not correctly aggregate the remaining inventory quantities before ordering, leading to potentially incorrect results if there are multiple entries for the same material."
15.json,True,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified the material with the lowest remaining inventory as ""Silk"" and provided the correct material ID. The process used by the tested model, although different from the standard answer, effectively retrieved the necessary information."
16.json,True,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional details (Planned Number, Completed Number, Status) which are not required by the original question but do not contradict the required information. The core information about the tasks starting after May 1, 2024, is accurate and matches the standard answer."
17.json,False,Else,"The tested model provided additional columns (Planned Number, Completed Number, Status) that were not requested in the original question or present in the standard answer. While the core information matches, the inclusion of extra, unnecessary details deviates from the expected response format."
18.json,True,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
19.json,False,Else,"The tested model provided additional information (Order Product ID, Planned Number, Completed Number, Status) that was not requested in the original question. While the core information about sewing tasks using Silk is correct, the inclusion of extra details makes the answer deviate from the expected format."

21.json,True,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
22.json,True,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly retrieves and presents the sewing and cutting groups, even though the format is slightly different from the standard answer."
23.json,True,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
24.json,False,Wrong COT,"The tested model used an incorrect SQL query to retrieve tasks with an end time before June 30, 2024, instead of a start time. Although the final answer matches the standard answer, the process to obtain it was incorrect."
25.json,True,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
26.json,False,Information Deviation,"The tested model failed to retrieve the correct raw materials associated with the ""Skilled Sewers"" working group. The SQL query in the final step did not return any results, which indicates a deviation from the expected information retrieval process. The standard answer provides a detailed list of raw materials, which the tested model did not produce."
27.json,False,Wrong COT,"The tested model's answer includes tasks that have already been completed, as indicated by the completed numbers matching the planned numbers in the standard answer's SQL query results. The model incorrectly identified these tasks as incomplete, leading to a mismatch with the standard answer."
28.json,True,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
29.json,True,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified ""Master Sewers"" as the workgroup with the highest remaining workload and provided a summary of the remaining workloads for each workgroup, which matches the standard answer. The SQL queries used in the process are also correct and align with the logic needed to derive the answer."
30.json,True,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided the correct number of sewing tasks and the product types, aligning with the standard answer. The additional detail of listing each sewing task ID with its product type does not contradict the standard answer."

32.json,True,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
33.json,True,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
34.json,False,Else,"The tested model provided additional information that was not requested in the original question, such as order name, product attributes, and material details. While this information is correct, it deviates from the original question's requirement, which was to list only the completed cutting tasks with specific details (Task ID, Start Time, End Time, Product ID). The additional details, although accurate, are unnecessary and not aligned with the expected output format."
35.json,False,Else,"The tested model's answer includes an additional column ""Allocated Quantity"" which was not requested in the original question. The original question only asked for the materials allocated, not the quantities. The inclusion of this extra information makes the answer incorrect as it does not align with the requirements of the original question."
36.json,True,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
37.json,False,Wrong COT,"The tested model's answer only identifies Task ID 5 as having the highest planned quantity, while the standard answer correctly identifies both Task ID 5 and Task ID 31 as having the highest planned quantity of 260. The tested model's process of generating the answer did not account for the possibility of multiple tasks having the same highest planned quantity, leading to an incomplete answer."
38.json,True,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
39.json,False,Wrong COT,"The tested model's answer does not match the standard answer. The process used by the tested model to generate the answer involves retrieving cutting tasks based on WIP materials, which is different from the standard answer's process of retrieving cutting tasks based on warehouse material IDs. This leads to a different set of cutting tasks being identified."
40.json,False,Wrong COT,"The tested model's answer only provides the cutting task IDs without the additional details such as start time, end time, and working group name, which are present in the standard answer. The process of generating the answer also lacks the necessary steps to retrieve these additional details."
41.json,True,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully created the order with the correct details and followed a logical process to achieve this.
42.json,True,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.

45.json,True,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
46.json,True,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
47.json,False,Wrong COT,"The tested model's response indicates an error in the process of creating cutting tasks due to missing WIP material IDs, which is inconsistent with the standard answer. The standard answer successfully creates cutting tasks with specific IDs, while the tested model fails to do so and reports an error instead."
48.json,True,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully retrieved the necessary IDs and updated the cutting tasks as requested, and the final response accurately reflects the successful transfer of tasks."
49.json,True,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully retrieved the planned number and updated the completed quantity, matching the standard answer's logic and outcome."
50.json,True,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully retrieved the current end time and updated it to the new end time as requested, matching the standard answer."
51.json,False,Wrong COT,"The tested model incorrectly identifies ""Sophia_SkirtAndJacket"" as the only order with the fastest completion progress. The standard answer shows that multiple orders have a completion progress of 1.0000, indicating a tie for the fastest progress. The tested model's logic fails to account for all orders with the same highest progress value."
52.json,False,Wrong COT,"The tested model's answer does not match the standard answer, and the process of generating the answer is incorrect. The quantities and materials listed in the tested model's response do not align with those in the standard answer, indicating a deviation in the logical process used to derive the results."
53.json,True,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
54.json,False,Wrong calculation,"The tested model incorrectly calculated the progress percentage for the ""Elite Sewers"" group. The standard answer shows a progress percentage of 44.0678% for ""Elite Sewers,"" but the tested model's answer shows 100.00%. This discrepancy indicates an error in the calculation process."
