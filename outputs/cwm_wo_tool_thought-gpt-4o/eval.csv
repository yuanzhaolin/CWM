26.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model provided a list of material IDs without detailing the original materials and their quantities as required. The standard answer includes a detailed breakdown of original materials and their quantities, which the tested model failed to provide.
52.json;False; Wrong syntax; The tested model encountered errors in the SQL queries, specifically an "Unknown column 'wip_id' in 'field list'" error and a syntax error in the SQL query. These errors prevented the model from retrieving the necessary data to answer the question.
53.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
27.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model incorrectly identified tasks 22 and 25 as not completed. According to the SQL query results, task 22 is in progress, and task 25 is completed. The standard answer correctly identifies only task 33 as not completed.
34.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model included additional columns "Planned Number" and "Completed Number" in its answer, which were not part of the standard answer. The standard answer focused on "Product ID" instead. The model's logic deviated from the expected process by retrieving and presenting different data.
33.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional information (Order Name, Product Attributes, Product Description) which is not present in the standard answer but does not contradict the original question or the standard answer.
51.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model provided a completion progress for each order and identified "PolyU_Tshirt" as having the fastest completion progress. However, the standard answer indicates that there was a technical error in retrieving the progress data, and thus no order could be determined to have the fastest completion progress. The tested model's response does not align with the standard answer's logic, which acknowledges the inability to determine the fastest completion progress due to a technical issue.
9.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided a correct summary of the progress of sewing tasks for William, indicating that all tasks are 100% completed. The process used to generate this answer, including the SQL queries, was also correct and aligned with the standard answer's logic.
22.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly retrieves and presents the sewing and cutting groups, even though the format is slightly different from the standard answer.
50.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
32.json;False; Wrong calculation; The tested model's answer contains incorrect values for the "Completed Number" and "Status" fields for some tasks. Specifically, for Task ID 11, the "Completed Number" should be 140, not 100, and the "Status" should be "In Progress" with a different emoji. For Task IDs 12 and 13, the "Completed Number" should be 150 and 130, respectively, not 120. The model's SQL query results were correct, but the final answer did not accurately reflect these results.
54.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided the correct progress percentages for all sewing groups, and the logic used to generate the answer aligns with the standard answer's process. The slight difference in the number of decimal places in the output is acceptable and does not affect the correctness of the answer.
28.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model correctly identifies that not all sewing tasks are completed, but it does not provide the detailed status of each task as shown in the standard answer. The standard answer includes a breakdown of the status for each order product ID, which is missing in the tested model's response.
8.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the original question. It provided a list of material names and IDs without detailing the specific materials used in each product of Olivia's order, as required by the original question. The standard answer includes a detailed breakdown of materials per product, which the tested model failed to provide.
5.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
14.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer does not include the total remaining inventory, which is a key part of the standard answer. Additionally, the process used by the tested model does not correctly aggregate the remaining inventory quantities before determining the material with the highest inventory.
11.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
41.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully retrieved the necessary customer and product IDs, created the order, and inserted the correct quantities of each product into the order. The final output matches the standard answer in terms of order details and confirmation of successful order creation.
15.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer does not include the remaining inventory quantity, which is part of the standard answer. The process of generating the answer also differs from the standard answer, as it retrieves only the material ID and name without considering the remaining inventory quantity.
49.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model did not attempt to update the completed quantity and did not address the update error that occurred in the standard answer. The model only retrieved the planned quantity and suggested updating the completed quantity without acknowledging the technical issue.
21.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model included a task (Task ID 25) that falls outside the specified date range of April to May 2024. Additionally, the completed number for Task ID 22 is incorrect compared to the standard answer. The model's status legend is also inconsistent with the standard answer, where the standard answer uses descriptive status terms instead of numeric codes.
16.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional details (Planned Number, Completed Number, Status) which are not required by the original question but do not affect the correctness of the answer. The core information about the tasks starting after May 1, 2024, is accurate.
13.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model's response matches the standard answer, and the SQL query used in the process correctly retrieves the necessary data to provide the correct output.
31.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer incorrectly lists the "Completed Number" for Task ID 11 as 100, whereas the standard answer shows it as 140. The SQL query results in the tested model's process also show the "Completed Number" for Task ID 11 as 100, which matches the model's answer but does not match the standard answer. This discrepancy indicates a deviation from the expected logic and data interpretation.
10.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer includes a list of unfinished products that is significantly longer than the standard answer. The standard answer correctly identifies only two unfinished products (Sweater and Shorts), while the tested model's answer includes many additional products that are not part of the order "Michael_SweaterAndShorts". This indicates a mistake in the logical process of determining which products are unfinished for the specific order.
35.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model's response matches the standard answer in terms of the materials allocated for each cutting task, and the SQL queries used to generate the answer are appropriate and correctly executed.
6.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's response does not include the quantities of the products, which is a crucial part of the standard answer. Additionally, the model incorrectly references an order named "James_WinterOrder" instead of focusing on PolyU's January 2024 orders. The process of generating the answer also skips retrieving the order IDs for January 2024, which is essential for ensuring the correct products are listed.
24.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
25.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model incorrectly provided a list of tasks that were supposedly completed by "Master Sewers" after February 1, 2024, despite the standard answer indicating that there were no such tasks. The model's answer does not align with the standard answer's logic and results.
36.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model provided additional information (Planned Number, Completed Number, Status) that was not requested in the original question. The original question only asked for the cutting tasks, which includes Task ID, Start Time, End Time, Working Group Name, and Order Product ID. The inclusion of extra columns deviates from the expected output format.
47.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified the issue with the missing default value for the 'produced_wip_id' field and provided a detailed explanation of the steps taken, which aligns with the standard answer.
19.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer includes sewing tasks with IDs 11, 12, 13, and 14, which do not match the sewing tasks listed in the standard answer. The process used by the tested model to generate the answer diverges from the standard answer's process, leading to a different set of sewing tasks being identified.
45.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model provided additional information about the current stock and remaining stock after release, which was not part of the original request. The original request was simply to release 100 units, and the standard answer focused on confirming the release without additional stock details.
43.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer lacks the quantity information and the action of inserting a new entry to store 1000 units of Leather in the Main Warehouse, which is a crucial part of the standard answer's logic.
30.json;False; Wrong syntax; The model encountered a syntax error in the SQL query when attempting to retrieve product details, resulting in an inability to fetch the product types for the completed sewing tasks.
20.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
23.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model failed to compare the Cotton Fabric quantities between the Main and Auxiliary Warehouses. It only retrieved the quantity for the Main Warehouse and did not attempt to retrieve or compare the quantity for the Auxiliary Warehouse, leading to an incomplete conclusion.
38.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer includes an "Order Name" column with "John_Pants," which is not present in the standard answer. The standard answer only includes "Order ID" and "Customer Name" columns. The tested model's process deviates from the standard answer's logic by retrieving additional information (order name) that was not required.
4.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer does not match the standard answer in terms of the logical reasoning process. The model retrieved product IDs and attributes correctly but failed to include the quantity of each product in the final answer, which is a crucial part of the information requested. Additionally, the format of the answer does not match the standard answer, which includes order IDs and quantities.
7.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
29.json;False; Wrong calculation; The tested model incorrectly calculated the remaining workload for the "Master Sewers" as 40, while the standard answer shows it as 0. The discrepancy arises from the SQL query results in the tested model's process, where the total completed number for "Master Sewers" is incorrectly listed as 1220 instead of 1260, leading to an incorrect remaining workload calculation.
55.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
1.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer includes an incorrect order name "Order20240702120000" which does not match the standard answer. The process of generating the answer shows that the model retrieved an incorrect order name from the SQL query results.
39.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer does not match the standard answer. The model retrieved cutting task IDs based on the WIP material ID, which led to a different set of cutting task IDs than those using the warehouse material ID for "Leather" as per the standard answer.
42.json;False; Else; The tested model's response does not confirm that the sewing tasks have been set to "start status," which is a crucial part of the original request. The standard answer indicates that the update was successful, while the tested model only provides the IDs and suggests the next steps without confirming the completion of the task.
18.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model included additional cutting tasks (IDs 31 and 34) that were not present in the standard answer. The standard answer only included tasks with IDs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 19, 21, and 28. The inclusion of these extra tasks indicates a deviation from the correct logical process used to generate the standard answer.
40.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model provided additional columns (Planned Number, Completed Number, Status) that were not part of the standard answer. The standard answer focused on Task ID, Start Time, End Time, and Working Group Name, which are the relevant details for the question asked. The tested model's response deviated from the expected output format and included unnecessary information.
12.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
44.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
2.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer is based on a different logic than the standard answer. The standard answer checks the completion status of cutting and sewing tasks for each order, while the tested model checks the total number of products against the total completed number for each order product. This leads to a different conclusion about the completion status of John's orders.
3.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model incorrectly calculates the overall production progress as a single percentage (85.19%) instead of providing the progress for each sewing task as shown in the standard answer. The standard answer breaks down the progress for each task, which is the correct approach based on the given data.
17.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model included additional columns such as "Planned Number," "Completed Number," and "Status" in its response, which were not part of the standard answer. The standard answer only required the task ID, start time, end time, working group name, and order product ID. The inclusion of extra details deviates from the expected output format.
48.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model did not follow the correct process to update the working group ID for the tasks. It only retrieved the task ID but did not perform the necessary update operation to transfer the task to the "Premier Sewers" group. Additionally, it did not address the syntax error issue that was present in the standard answer's process.
37.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
46.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully allocated the materials and provided a detailed allocation summary, which aligns with the standard answer.
