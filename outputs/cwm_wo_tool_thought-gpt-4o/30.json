    "gt": "Hey there! 😄 Let's dive into the details of the sewing tasks completed by the \"Skilled Sewers\" before June 2024.\n\nBased on the data, the \"Skilled Sewers\" completed **2 sewing tasks**. However, there was a little hiccup when trying to retrieve the types of products produced for these tasks. It seems there was an issue with the database query, so we couldn't fetch the product details this time. 😅\n\nHere's a quick summary:\n\n| Sewing Task ID | Order Product ID |\n|----------------|------------------|\n| 17             | 17               |\n| 18             | 18               |\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! 😊",
