ID: 13, Name: Down\n  8. ID: 14, Name: Down Pieces\n\n### Step 2 Results:\n- Remaining quantities of materials:\n  1. Material ID: 1, Remaining Quantity: 3500\n  2. Material ID: 2, Remaining Quantity: 3200\n  3. Material ID: 3, Remaining Quantity: 4100\n  4. Material ID: 4, Remaining Quantity: 3550\n  5. Material ID: 5, Remaining Quantity: 1100\n  6.
