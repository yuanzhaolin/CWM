The tested model correctly identified "Silk Pieces" as the material with the highest remaining inventory and provided a detailed list of all materials and their quantities, which is consistent with the data retrieved.
27.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model included Task ID 25 as not completed, but according to the standard answer and the SQL query results, Task ID 25 is completed. The model incorrectly identified it as incomplete, leading to a deviation from the standard answer.
51.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model incorrectly identified "Emily_Dress" as the order with the fastest completion progress among the unfinished orders. The correct answer, as per the standard answer, is that multiple orders have a progress of 1.0000, which is higher than the progress of "Emily_Dress" (0.8519). The model's logic in determining the order with the highest progress is flawed, as it did not correctly identify the orders with a progress of 1.0000.
32.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model's response matches the standard answer in terms of data and conclusion, and the SQL queries used to generate the answer are also correct.

The slight difference in the presentation of the status key does not affect the correctness of the answer.
7.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer states that there are 2 orders in total for PolyU, which matches the SQL query result but contradicts the standard answer's conclusion of 3 orders. The model's conclusion does not align with the standard answer.
21.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model included a task (ID 25) that falls outside the specified date range of April to May 2024. Additionally, the completed number for task ID 22 is incorrect compared to the standard answer. The status representation is also inconsistent with the standard answer, where the standard uses descriptive text and emojis, while the tested model uses numeric codes.
24.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided a more detailed response by including additional information such as the order name and product attributes, but the core information matches the standard answer.
11.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer includes incorrect task details. It lists "Cutting Task 2" with "Master Cutters" and "PolyU_Tshirt" which does not match the standard answer. The standard answer only includes tasks with IDs 1 and 3, while the tested model incorrectly includes a task with ID 2.
45.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully released 100 units of Cotton Fabric from the Main Warehouse and provided a summary of the current stock, which matches the standard answer. The logic and SQL queries used in the process are also correct.
47.json;False; Wrong syntax; The tested model encountered an error during the SQL insertion process due to a missing default value for the `produced_wip_id` field, resulting in no cutting tasks being generated. This error in the SQL operation led to the failure of the task creation process.
13.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model's response matches the standard answer in terms of content and format, and the logic used to generate the answer is sound.
30.json;False; Else; The tested model's answer includes duplicate entries for the product type "Jacket," which is unnecessary. The standard answer correctly lists "Jacket" once, as it is the only distinct product type. The model's process of generating the answer also reflects this duplication, which is not aligned with the standard answer's concise presentation.
3.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model calculated the overall production progress for all sewing tasks combined, resulting in a single percentage (85.19%), whereas the standard answer provided individual progress percentages for each sewing task. The model's approach deviates from the expected breakdown of progress by each sewing task.
48.json;False; Wrong syntax; The model attempted to update tasks with an empty list of task IDs, resulting in a SQL syntax error. The error occurred because the model did not handle the case where no tasks were found to transfer, leading to an incorrect SQL update statement.
12.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer includes additional details such as "Order Name" and "Attributes" which are not present in the standard answer. The standard answer focuses on "Task ID", "End Time", "Working Group Name", and "Order Product ID". The tested model's process involves additional SQL queries and transformations that deviate from the standard answer's logic and focus.
4.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer does not match the standard answer. The product details, including attributes and quantities, are incorrect compared to the standard answer.
