However, based on the available information, \"Main Warehouse\" has 3500 units of \"Cotton Fabric,\" and there is no recorded quantity for \"Auxiliary Warehouse,\" which suggests that \"Main Warehouse\" has more \"Cotton Fabric\" than \"Auxiliary Warehouse,\" assuming the latter has zero or an unrecorded amount."
