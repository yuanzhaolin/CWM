            "results": "To achieve the objective, we need to replace the `order_product_id` in the sewing tasks with the corresponding order name and product attributes, focusing on tasks that are not yet completed for the \"Advanced Sewers\" group. Based on the context provided, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Incomplete Tasks**: From the results of Step 2, we need to identify tasks that are not yet completed. The status of a task indicates its completion: a status of `0` means the task is not completed, while a status of `1` means it is completed. Therefore, we focus on tasks with a status of `0`.\n\n2. **Retrieve Order Product Details**: From the results of Step 3, we have the order name and product attributes for each `order_product_id`. We will use this information to replace the `order_product_id` in the incomplete tasks.\n\n3. **Compile the Detailed List**: For each incomplete task, we will compile a detailed list that includes the task ID, start time, end time, order name, product attributes, planned number, completed number, and status.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the data:\n\n- **Incomplete Tasks**: From Step 2, the tasks with status `0` are:\n  - Task ID 22: `order_product_id` 22\n  - Task ID 25: `order_product_id` 25\n  - Task ID 33: `order_product_id` 33\n\n- **Order Product Details**: From Step 3, the details for these `order_product_id`s are:\n  - `order_product_id` 22: Order Name \"Michael_SweaterAndShorts\", Attributes \"Blue, S size\"\n  - `order_product_id` 25: Order Name \"Olivia_WinterOrder\", Attributes \"Purple, S size\"\n  - `order_product_id` 33: Order Name \"Emily_Pants\", Attributes \"Grey, 29 size\"\n\n- **Detailed List of Incomplete Tasks**:\n  - Task ID 22:\n    - Start Time: 2024-04-09\n    - End Time: 2024-04-22\n    - Order Name: Michael_SweaterAndShorts\n    - Product Attributes: Blue, S size\n    - Planned Number: 115\n    - Completed Number: 60\n    - Status: 0 (Not Completed)\n  \n  - Task ID 25:\n    - Start Time: 2024-05-14\n    - End Time: 2024-06-03\n    - Order Name: Olivia_WinterOrder\n    - Product Attributes: Purple, S size\n    - Planned Number: 75\n    - Completed Number: 75\n    - Status: 0 (Not Completed)\n  \n  - Task ID 33:\n    - Start Time: 2024-07-17\n    - End Time: 2024-08-03\n    - Order Name: Emily_Pants\n    - Product Attributes: Grey, 29 size\n    - Planned Number: 120\n    - Completed Number: 0\n    - Status: 0 (Not Completed)\n\nThis detailed list provides the necessary information about the tasks that are not yet completed for the \"Advanced Sewers\" group, with the `order_product_id` replaced by the corresponding order name and product attributes."
