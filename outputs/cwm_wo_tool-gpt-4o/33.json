            "results": "To achieve the objective, we need to replace the `order_product_id` with the corresponding product name and the `produced_wip_id` with the corresponding WIP material name. This requires joining the `cutting_tasks` with the `order_product`, `products`, and `materials` tables. Here is how you can perform this step:\n\n1. **Join `cutting_tasks` with `order_product` and `products` tables:**\n   - Use the `order_product_id` from `cutting_tasks` to join with the `order_product` table to get the `product_id`.\n   - Then, use the `product_id` to join with the `products` table to get the `product_name`.\n\n2. **Join `cutting_tasks` with `materials` table:**\n   - Use the `produced_wip_id` from `cutting_tasks` to join with the `materials` table to get the `material_name`.\n\nHere is the SQL query to perform these joins and retrieve the desired information:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    ct.id,\n    ct.start_time,\n    ct.end_time,\n    p.name AS product_name,\n    m.name AS wip_material_name,\n    ct.planned_number,\n    ct.completed_number,\n    ct.status\nFROM \n    cutting_tasks ct\nJOIN \n    order_product op ON ct.order_product_id = op.id\nJOIN \n    products p ON op.product_id = p.id\nJOIN \n    materials m ON ct.produced_wip_id = m.id\nWHERE \n    ct.working_group_id = 1;\n```\n\nThis query will provide the cutting tasks with the `order_product_id` replaced by the `product_name` and the `produced_wip_id` replaced by the `wip_material_name`."
