Here's how we can do it based on the provided context:\n\n1. **Identify the Order Quantity for Each Product:**\n   - From the context, we have the latest order with `order_id = 9` and it includes a product with `product_id = 15`.\n\n2. **Retrieve the WIP Material Requirements:**\n   - The WIP material requirements for `product_id = 15` are:\n     - `material_id = 8` requires `5` units.\n     - `material_id = 10` requires `2` units.\n\n3. **Assume Order Quantity:**\n   - Since the order quantity for `product_id = 15` is not explicitly provided in the context, let's assume an order quantity. For example, if the order quantity is `10` units, we can proceed with the calculations.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Demand for Each WIP Material:**\n   - For `material_id = 8`: Total demand = `5` (units per product) * `10` (order quantity) = `50` units.\n   - For `material_id = 10`: Total demand = `2` (units per product) * `10` (order quantity) = `20` units.\n\nThus, the total demand for each WIP material, assuming an order quantity of 10, would be 50 units for `material_id = 8` and 20 units for `material_id = 10`. If the actual order quantity is different, you would need to adjust the calculations accordingly."

This means the cutting tasks couldn't be created as planned. 😅\n\nTo resolve this, we need to ensure that all required fields, like `produced_wip_id`, have appropriate values or defaults set before attempting to create the tasks again. Once that's sorted, we can proceed with generating the task IDs. If you need further assistance or have any questions, feel free to ask! 😊",
