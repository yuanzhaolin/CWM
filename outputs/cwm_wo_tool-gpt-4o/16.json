Here is how you can perform this task:\n\n1. **Retrieve the necessary data from the `working_group`, `order_product`, and `materials` tables:**\n\n   - **Working Group Table:**\n     ```sql\n     SELECT id, name FROM working_group;\n     ```\n   - **Order Product Table:**\n     ```sql\n     SELECT id, name FROM order_product;\n     ```\n   - **Materials Table:**\n     ```sql\n     SELECT id, name FROM materials;\n     ```\n\n2. **Join the retrieved data with the cutting tasks:**\n\n   Using the results from the above queries, you can perform the following joins to replace the IDs with names:\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT \n     ct.id,\n     ct.start_time,\n     ct.end_time,\n     wg.name AS working_group_name,\n     op.name AS product_name,\n     m.name AS wip_material_name,\n     ct.planned_number,\n     ct.completed_number,\n     ct.status\n   FROM \n     cutting_tasks ct\n   JOIN \n     working_group wg ON ct.working_group_id = wg.id\n   JOIN \n     order_product op ON ct.order_product_id = op.id\n   JOIN \n     materials m ON ct.produced_wip_id = m.id\n   WHERE \n     ct.start_time > '2024-05-01';\n   ```\n\n3. **Expected Output:**\n\n   This query will provide you with a list of cutting tasks where the `working_group_id`, `order_product_id`, and `produced_wip_id` have been replaced with their corresponding names from the `working_group`, `order_product`, and `materials` tables, respectively."
