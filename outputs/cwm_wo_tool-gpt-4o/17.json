Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. **Mapping Working Group IDs to Names:**\n   - From Step2, we have the mapping of `working_group_id` to `name`:\n     - `8` -> \"Advanced Sewers\"\n     - `9` -> \"Premier Sewers\"\n     - `10` -> \"Elite Sewers\"\n\n2. **Mapping Order Product IDs to Order Names and Product Attributes:**\n   - From Step3, we have the mapping of `order_product_id` to `order_name` and `attributes`:\n     - `32` -> \"John_Jacket\", \"Black, XL size\"\n     - `33` -> \"Emily_Pants\", \"Grey, 29 size\"\n     - `34` -> \"James_Skirt\", \"Purple, M size\"\n\n3. **Replacing IDs in Sewing Tasks:**\n   - For each sewing task from Step1, replace the `working_group_id` and `order_product_id` with the corresponding names and attributes.\n\nHere are the updated sewing tasks:\n\n- Task ID: 32\n  - Start Time: 2024-06-17\n  - End Time: 2024-07-14\n  - Working Group: \"Premier Sewers\"\n  - Order Name: \"John_Jacket\"\n  - Product Attributes: \"Black, XL size\"\n  - Planned Number: 150\n  - Completed Number: 0\n  - Status: 0\n\n- Task ID: 33\n  - Start Time: 2024-07-17\n  - End Time: 2024-08-03\n  - Working Group: \"Advanced Sewers\"\n  - Order Name: \"Emily_Pants\"\n  - Product Attributes: \"Grey, 29 size\"\n  - Planned Number: 120\n  - Completed Number: 0\n  - Status: 0\n\n- Task ID: 34\n  - Start Time: 2024-07-10\n  - End Time: 2024-07-20\n  - Working Group: \"Elite Sewers\"\n  - Order Name: \"James_Skirt\"\n  - Product Attributes: \"Purple, M size\"\n  - Planned Number: 330\n  - Completed Number: 0\n  - Status: 0\n\nThese updated tasks now reflect the names and attributes instead of the IDs."
