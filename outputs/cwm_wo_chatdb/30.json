Select the working group where `working_group.name = 'Skilled Sewers'` to get the working group ID. 2. Join `sewing_tasks` with the working group ID and filter the tasks where `completed_number > 0` and `end_time < '2024-06-01'`. 3. Join the filtered sewing tasks with `order_product` and then `products` to get the product type IDs. 4. Join the resulting product types with `products_types` to get the product type descriptions. 5. Count the number of sewing tasks and group by product type descriptions.",
