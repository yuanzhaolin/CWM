Identify the ID of the 'Advanced Cutters' working group from the `working_group` table. 2. Find all cutting tasks assigned to this working group that have not been completed (`completed_number` is less than `planned_number`). 3. Retrieve the order IDs from the `order_product` table using `order_product_id` linked to the above cutting tasks. 4. Fetch and display the order details using the order IDs found in the previous step.",
