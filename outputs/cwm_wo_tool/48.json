Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Current Group**: Advanced Sewers\n2. **Target Group**: Premier Sewers\n3. **Task Type**: Cutting tasks\n4. **Date Range**: May 1, 2024, to May 30, 2024\n\nHere's what we found:\n\n| Task | Current Group | Target Group | Status |\n|------|---------------|--------------|--------|\n| Cutting Tasks | Advanced Sewers | Premier Sewers | Transfer Attempted |\n\nUnfortunately, there was a little hiccup with the transfer process due to a syntax error in the SQL query. 😅 But don't worry, this can be fixed by ensuring the correct task IDs are included in the update query.\n\nIf you need further assistance or have any questions, feel free to ask! 😊",
