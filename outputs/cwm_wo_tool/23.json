    "gt": "Sure thing! Let's dive into the details and find out which warehouse has more Cotton Fabric. 🏢\n\nHere's what we have:\n\n| Warehouse Name       | Cotton Fabric Quantity |\n|----------------------|------------------------|\n| Main Warehouse       | 3400                   |\n| Auxiliary Warehouse  | Not available          |\n\nIt looks like we only have data for the Main Warehouse, which has 3400 units of Cotton Fabric. Unfortunately, we don't have the quantity for the Auxiliary Warehouse. Based on the available information, the Main Warehouse has more Cotton Fabric. 🎉\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! 😊",
