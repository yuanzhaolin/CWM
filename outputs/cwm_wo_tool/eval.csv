26.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model provided a list of unique material IDs, but it did not follow the correct process to identify the original materials used by the "Skilled Sewers" as specified in the standard answer. The standard answer involves retrieving work-in-progress materials and their corresponding original materials, which the tested model did not do.
52.json;False; Wrong syntax; The tested model encountered errors in the SQL queries, specifically an "Unknown column 'wip_id'" error and syntax errors in subsequent queries. These errors prevented the model from retrieving the necessary data to answer the question, resulting in an incomplete response.
53.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
27.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model included tasks with IDs 22 and 25 as not completed, but according to the standard answer, only task ID 33 is pending completion. The model incorrectly identified tasks that were either completed or not relevant to the query.
34.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer only provides the Task ID without additional details such as start time, end time, and product ID, which are present in the standard answer. The model's process also lacks the necessary join with the order_product table to retrieve the complete information about the completed tasks.
33.json;False; Else; The tested model provided additional information (Order Name, Product Attributes, Product Description) that was not requested in the original question. While the core information about the cutting tasks is correct, the inclusion of extra details deviates from the expected answer format.
51.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model provided a completion progress table and identified several orders as having 100% completion progress, which contradicts the premise of the question that these orders are unfinished. The model misunderstood the task by assuming it could calculate completion progress despite the SQL query error in the standard answer, which indicated a technical issue preventing such calculations.
9.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
22.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly retrieves and presents the sewing and cutting groups, even though the format is slightly different from the standard answer.
50.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The model successfully updated the expected completion date for cutting task 33 to July 31, 2024, and confirmed the update in its response.
32.json;False; Wrong calculation; The tested model's answer contains incorrect values for the "Completed Number" and "Status" fields for some tasks. For example, Task ID 11 should have a "Completed Number" of 140 and a "Status" of "In Progress," but the model incorrectly lists 100 and "In Progress." Similarly, Task ID 12 should have a "Completed Number" of 150 and a "Status" of "Complete," but the model lists 120 and "Completed." These discrepancies indicate errors in the calculation or interpretation of the SQL query results.
54.json;False; Wrong calculation; The tested model's answer contains a slight discrepancy in the progress percentage for the "Advanced Sewers" group. The model calculated it as 82.00%, whereas the correct calculation should be 81.9588% as per the standard answer. This indicates a rounding or calculation error in the model's process.
28.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified the status of the sewing tasks and provided an accurate response based on the SQL query results. The difference in the presentation of the table (using "Sewing Task ID" instead of "Order Product ID") does not affect the correctness of the answer.
8.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer does not match the standard answer's logical reasoning process. The standard answer provides a detailed breakdown of the original materials and their quantities for each product in Olivia's order, while the tested model only lists material IDs and names without specifying the quantities or the relationship to specific products.
5.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
14.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
11.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.

The tested model provided a correct answer by retrieving the cutting tasks that will be completed before April 30, 2024. It included additional details such as Order Product Number, Customer Name, Order Name, Attributes, and Description, which were not required by the original question but do not detract from the correctness of the answer. The SQL query used by the tested model was also correct and successfully retrieved the necessary data.
41.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully created the order with the correct details and followed a logical process to achieve this.
15.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
49.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's response indicates that the update was successful, which contradicts the standard answer that reports an error during the update process. The model's logic in handling the update process does not align with the standard answer's logic, which correctly identifies an issue with the SQL update operation.
21.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model included a task (ID 25) that falls outside the specified date range (April to May 2024). Additionally, the completed number for task ID 22 is incorrect compared to the standard answer. The model also used numeric status codes instead of descriptive status labels, which deviates from the standard answer's format.
16.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional details (Planned Number, Completed Number, Status) which are not required by the original question but do not affect the correctness of the answer. The core information about the tasks starting after May 1, 2024, is accurate and matches the standard answer.
13.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided the correct list of raw materials with non-zero inventory, and the SQL query used in the process correctly retrieves the necessary data.
31.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer incorrectly lists the "Completed Number" for Task ID 11 as 100 instead of 140, and the status for Task ID 26 as "Completed" instead of "In Progress". The model's process of generating the answer shows it retrieved the correct data, but it did not accurately reflect this data in its final answer.
10.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
35.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model's response matches the standard answer in terms of content and structure, and the SQL queries used to generate the answer are correct and consistent with the standard answer's process.
6.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's response does not include the quantities of the products, which is a crucial part of the standard answer. Additionally, the model incorrectly references an order named "James_WinterOrder," which is not mentioned in the original question or the standard answer. The model's process also skips retrieving the order IDs for January 2024, leading to a lack of specificity in the response.
24.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
25.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the task. It failed to recognize that there were no results for sewing tasks completed by "Master Sewers" created after February 1, 2024, and instead focused on the lack of specific task details in the SQL result.
36.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional details (Planned Number, Completed Number, Status) which are not required by the original question but do not affect the correctness of the answer.
47.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified the issue with the missing default value for the 'produced_wip_id' field and provided a summary of the attempted task creation, which aligns with the standard answer.
19.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer does not match the standard answer's logical reasoning process. The tested model retrieved sewing tasks using a different method, which resulted in a different set of sewing tasks being identified. The standard answer identified a broader set of tasks, while the tested model's process led to a more limited and different set of tasks.
45.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model provided additional information about the current stock and remaining stock after the release, which was not requested in the original question. The original question only asked for the release of 100 units, not for a stock check or remaining stock calculation. The model's response deviates from the expected output format and content.
43.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the task. Instead of preparing to send 1000 units of Leather to the Main Warehouse, it checked the current status of Leather in the warehouse and concluded that there is enough space, which was not the requested action. The task was to store 1000 units, not to verify existing stock.
30.json;False; Wrong syntax; The model encountered SQL syntax errors when attempting to retrieve product types. Specifically, there was an "Unknown column 'order_product_id'" error and a syntax error due to an empty list in the SQL query. These errors prevented the model from obtaining the correct product types, leading to an incomplete answer.
20.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
23.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified that the Main Warehouse has 3400 units of Cotton Fabric and noted the absence of data for the Auxiliary Warehouse, which aligns with the standard answer.
38.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer includes an "Order Name" column, which is not present in the standard answer. The standard answer only includes "Order ID" and "Customer Name". Additionally, the tested model's process retrieves an "order_name" which is not required according to the standard answer's logic.
4.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer does not match the standard answer. The model retrieved the correct product details but failed to include the quantity of each product in the final answer, which is a crucial part of the information requested. Additionally, the order IDs are missing from the response, which are present in the standard answer.
7.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
29.json;False; Wrong calculation; The tested model incorrectly calculated the remaining workload for the "Master Sewers" as 40, while the correct remaining workload is 0. The SQL query results show that the total planned and completed numbers for "Master Sewers" are both 1260, indicating no remaining workload.
55.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified the top three products and their details, matching the standard answer.
1.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer includes an incorrect order name "Order20240702120000" which does not match the standard answer. The process of generating the answer shows that the model retrieved an incorrect order name from the SQL query results.
39.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer includes incorrect cutting task IDs and details that do not match the standard answer. The process used by the tested model to generate the answer involves retrieving cutting tasks based on WIP materials, which leads to a different set of tasks than those using the warehouse material IDs for "Leather" as per the standard answer.
42.json;False; Else; The tested model's answer is incomplete because it does not include the final step of updating the task status to "start," which is present in the standard answer's process. The tested model's process ends with retrieving the order_product IDs but does not confirm the update of the task status.
18.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer includes incorrect cutting task IDs and details that do not match the standard answer. The process of generating the answer involves retrieving cutting tasks based on WIP material IDs, which leads to a different set of tasks than those using "Cotton Fabric" directly. This indicates a deviation from the correct logic used in the standard answer.
40.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model provided additional information (Planned Number, Completed Number, Status) that was not requested in the original question. The original question only asked for the cutting tasks related to T-shirt products, which should include Task ID, Start Time, End Time, and Working Group Name, as shown in the standard answer. The tested model's response deviates from the expected output format and includes unnecessary details.
12.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model included additional columns "Product Description" and "Attributes" in its answer, which were not part of the original question or the standard answer. The standard answer only required the task ID, end time, working group name, and order product ID. The inclusion of extra information indicates a deviation from the expected logic and requirements.
44.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
2.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer is based on the completion status of order products rather than the specific tasks (cutting and sewing) associated with John's orders. The standard answer checks the completion of tasks within each order, which is the correct approach to determine if all orders are completed. The tested model incorrectly concludes that all orders are completed except for one order product, which does not align with the task-based completion criteria used in the standard answer.
3.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model incorrectly calculated the overall production progress by summing up the completed dresses and total dresses, then calculating a single percentage. The correct approach is to calculate the progress percentage for each sewing task individually, as shown in the standard answer.
17.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model included additional columns such as "Planned Number," "Completed Number," and "Status" in its response, which were not part of the standard answer. The standard answer only required the task ID, start time, end time, working group name, and order product ID. The inclusion of extra information indicates a deviation from the expected logic and output format.
48.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identifies the task transfer attempt and acknowledges the SQL syntax error, similar to the standard answer.
37.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional details about the task, but it correctly identified the task with the highest planned quantity among the specified cutting tasks.
46.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully allocated the materials and provided a correct summary of the allocation, including additional information about the allocation status, which is acceptable.
