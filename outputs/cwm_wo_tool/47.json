    "gt": "Hey there! 😄 It looks like we ran into a little hiccup while trying to create the cutting task. The system encountered an error because a required field, `produced_wip_id`, doesn't have a default value. \n\nHere's a quick summary of what we tried to do:\n\n| Task Detail                  | Information                      |\n|------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Customer Name                | PolyU                            |\n| Latest Order ID              | 13                               |\n| Product ID from Latest Order | 1                                |\n| Task Period                  | June 30th to July 12th, 2024     |\n| Cutting Team                 | Expert Cutters                   |\n\nUnfortunately, the task couldn't be created due to the missing `produced_wip_id`. You might want to check the database schema or provide a value for this field to proceed. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask! 😊",
