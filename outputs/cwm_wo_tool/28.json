    "gt": "Hello there! 😄 Let's take a look at the sewing tasks for the orders placed by PolyU in January. Here's what we found:\n\n| Sewing Task ID | Status       |\n|----------------|--------------|\n| 1              | Completed    |\n| 2              | In Progress  |\n| 3              | In Progress  |\n| 4              | In Progress  |\n| 5              | In Progress  |\n\nIt seems that not all the sewing tasks have been completed yet. Only Task ID 1 is marked as completed, while the others are still in progress. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! 😊",
