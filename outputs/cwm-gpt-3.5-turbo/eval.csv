54.json;False; Wrong calculation; The tested model's calculation of the progress percentages is incorrect. The progress percentages are given as decimal values (e.g., 0.5922 for Master Sewers) instead of percentages (e.g., 59.22%). The model failed to multiply the decimal results by 100 to convert them into percentage format, leading to incorrect progress percentages in the final answer.
49.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the original request. Instead of updating the completed quantity for the sewing task with ID 34, it attempted to retrieve unrelated information about a working group and an order, and then reported an error related to a function call. The response does not address the task completion update as required.
29.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
18.json;False; Wrong syntax; The tested model's SQL query contains a syntax error, as indicated by the error message in the SQL query result. This error prevents the model from retrieving the correct cutting task information, leading to an incorrect answer.
6.json;False; Wrong syntax; The model encountered a syntax error in the SQL query when attempting to retrieve the orders placed by the customer "PolyU" in January 2024. This error prevented the model from obtaining the correct order details, leading to an incorrect conclusion in the final answer.
42.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model included an unnecessary step to retrieve the working group ID for "Skilled Sewers" and used it in the update query, which was not part of the standard answer's logic. Additionally, the model set the status to 0 instead of 1, which is inconsistent with the standard answer.
40.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer does not match the standard answer. The model incorrectly states that there was an issue with allocating the cutting tasks, whereas the standard answer provides a detailed list of cutting tasks for the "T-shirt" category. The model's process also deviates from the correct logic by attempting to allocate tasks instead of retrieving existing cutting tasks.
19.json;False; Wrong syntax; The tested model encountered a syntax error in the SQL query during the process of retrieving sewing task IDs, which led to an incorrect conclusion that there are no sewing tasks using Silk.
52.json;False; Wrong syntax; The model's SQL query in step 3 resulted in an error due to a non-existent table 'order_product_material', leading to an incorrect answer.
36.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the original question. It provided information about "Expert Cutters" instead of "cutting tasks" for the customer "PolyU". The response does not match the expected output, which should include details of cutting tasks such as task ID, start time, end time, working group, planned number, completed number, and status.
16.json;False; Wrong syntax; The model's SQL query contains a syntax error, as indicated by the error message in the results. The query was not executed correctly, leading to an incorrect answer.
15.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified "Silk" as the material with the lowest remaining inventory and provided additional information, which is acceptable.
37.json;False; Wrong syntax; The tested model attempted to execute an SQL query but encountered a syntax error, resulting in a failure to retrieve the necessary information.
20.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
39.json;False; Wrong syntax; The model encountered a syntax error in the SQL query when attempting to retrieve the cutting task IDs. The error message indicates an issue with the use of brackets in the SQL query, which prevented the model from obtaining the correct cutting task IDs and subsequently the correct task details.
35.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer only lists the cutting task IDs without providing the allocated materials for each task, which is the main requirement of the original question. The model's process also indicates an unsuccessful attempt to retrieve the allocated materials, leading to an incomplete answer.
25.json;False; Wrong syntax; The model's SQL query in the answer generation process contains a syntax error, resulting in a failure to retrieve the correct data. The error is indicated by the SQL syntax error message in the process.
28.json;False; Wrong syntax; The tested model's process includes a tool call that failed due to missing required arguments, resulting in incomplete information for determining the sewing task completion status.
50.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the original question. It updated the end time for the working group 'Expert Cutters' instead of specifically updating the end time for cutting task 33. The task ID and the working group were confused, leading to an incorrect operation.
9.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's response does not provide the actual progress of the sewing tasks for William. Instead, it describes a process of calculating progress without delivering a final result. The standard answer clearly states that all tasks are completed, while the tested model fails to reach this conclusion.
23.json;False; Wrong syntax; The model encountered a syntax error in the SQL query for retrieving the total number of 'Cotton Fabric' in the Main Warehouse, which led to incorrect results in the final answer.
38.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The model correctly identified that there are no pending cutting tasks for the "Advanced Cutters" group, despite encountering an error in the SQL query. The conclusion matches the standard answer.
5.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
1.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the original question, which asked for the orders placed by PolyU, not the details of the products within those orders. The model provided product details instead of the order names and IDs, which does not align with the standard answer.
14.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified "Silk Pieces" as the material with the highest remaining inventory and provided additional information in a table format, which is acceptable.
27.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model included tasks with ID 25 and 38 as not completed, but according to the standard answer's logic, task 25 is completed (planned number equals completed number), and task 38 is not present in the standard answer's results. The model's conclusion about the tasks is incorrect.
51.json;False; Wrong syntax; The tested model's SQL query resulted in an error due to an unrecognized column 'status'. This indicates a syntax error in the SQL query, preventing the model from retrieving the necessary data to answer the question.
32.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model's response does not align with the original question, which asked for sewing tasks related to the "Dress" product type. Instead, the model provided information about sewing tasks and materials for various products, which do not match the expected details for dresses. The model misunderstood the request, leading to an incorrect and irrelevant answer.
8.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the original question, which asked for the materials used in Olivia's order, not the product details such as color, size, and quantity. The model provided product attributes instead of the materials used in the order.
34.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional details (Planned Number and Completed Number), but the core information matches the standard answer.
31.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the task. Instead of retrieving and displaying the detailed sewing tasks for the "Premier Sewers" working group, it provided an incorrect and irrelevant summary with "None" as the order name, which does not align with the expected detailed task information.
7.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer states there are 2 orders for PolyU, but the standard answer indicates there are 3 orders. The tested model's process retrieved 2 orders, but it did not correctly count the total number of orders, which should be 3 according to the standard answer.
21.json;False; Wrong syntax; The model's SQL query contains a syntax error, as indicated by the error message in the query result. This led to an incorrect answer being generated.
24.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the task by searching for a customer named "Elite Sewers" instead of a working group. This led to incorrect SQL queries and ultimately an incorrect conclusion that no results were found.
11.json;False; Wrong syntax; The tested model's response indicates a critical issue during the operation, suggesting a failure in executing the necessary process to retrieve the required information.
45.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model attempted to store materials instead of releasing them, which is contrary to the original request. Additionally, the tool used encountered an issue, and the model did not provide a correct response to the user's request.
47.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model failed to follow the correct process to generate the cutting tasks. It did not retrieve the required WIP materials and their quantities, nor did it perform the necessary calculations to determine the planned number for each cutting task. As a result, it did not create the cutting tasks or return their IDs, which is the expected outcome.
13.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model included additional materials such as "Fabric Pieces," "Wool Pieces," "Silk Pieces," etc., which were not part of the standard answer. The standard answer only included original material types, while the tested model's answer included both original and additional types, leading to a deviation from the expected result.
30.json;False; Wrong syntax; The tested model encountered a syntax error in the SQL query, which prevented it from retrieving the necessary data to answer the question.
3.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the task by focusing on an "Emily_Dress" order name, which was not specified in the original question. It also incorrectly assumed that the total completed quantity of sewing tasks was missing, while the standard answer provided a clear breakdown of the sewing tasks and their completion percentages.
48.json;False; Wrong syntax; The tested model's SQL queries contain syntax errors, leading to failed attempts to retrieve necessary data and perform the update operation. The model's response indicates it could not find results due to these errors.
12.json;True;; The tested model's answer includes all the necessary information about the sewing tasks that will be completed before May 31, 2024. Although it provides additional details such as start time, planned number, completed number, and status, the core information matches the standard answer. The SQL query used by the tested model is also correct, as it retrieves tasks with an end time before May 31, 2024.
4.json;False; Information Deviation; The tested model's answer only includes products from order ID 4 and omits the products from order ID 12, which are included in the standard answer.
17.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer includes tasks with start times on November 21, 2024, which are not present in the standard answer. The SQL query results in the tested model's process also include tasks with start times before June 1, 2024, indicating a misunderstanding or misapplication of the date filter.
41.json;False; Wrong syntax; The tested model encountered a syntax error during the SQL query for creating a new order, which is evident from the error message in the results. Additionally, the model attempted to retrieve and insert incorrect product types ("Dress" and "Jacket") instead of the requested "T-shirt" and "Sweater".
26.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the original question, which asked for the raw materials used by the "Skilled Sewers" working group. Instead, it provided information about products using a specific material, "Fabric Pieces," which is unrelated to the original question.
46.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the task. The original question was about allocating materials for a cutting task with ID=19, but the model's response focused on allocating materials for a working group named 'Expert Cutters', which was not mentioned in the original question. Additionally, the model's response did not complete the allocation process as requested.
53.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model provided only the IDs of the unfinished tasks without additional details such as start time, end time, working group name, order product ID, planned number, and completed number, which were included in the standard answer. The model's answer lacks the comprehensive information required by the original question.
22.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the request by providing only two specific groups instead of listing all current sewing and cutting groups. The SQL query was limited to 'Elite Sewers' and 'Expert Cutters', which does not fulfill the original question's requirement to list all such groups.
43.json;False; Else; The tested model's response indicates an inability to store the materials, which contradicts the standard answer's successful storage action. The error does not fit into the predefined categories, as it is not a syntax, calculation, or understanding error, nor is it a deviation in information retrieval. The issue lies in the execution or simulation of the storage action.
10.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the order name. It searched for an order named "SweaterAndShorts" instead of "Michael_SweaterAndShorts," leading to the incorrect conclusion that no results were found.
33.json;False; Information Deviation; The tested model included an additional task (Task ID 35) that was not present in the standard answer. This indicates a deviation in the information retrieved or presented compared to the standard answer.
2.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model incorrectly concluded that none of John's orders have been completed, while the standard answer indicates that some tasks are still pending, meaning not all orders are completed. The tested model's conclusion does not align with the standard answer's conclusion.
55.json;False; Wrong syntax; The model encountered a syntax error in the first SQL query, which resulted in an inability to retrieve the necessary product information. This led to the incorrect conclusion that no results were found for the top three products.
44.json;False; Wrong syntax; The model encountered an SQL error when trying to retrieve the product name, which led to an inability to proceed with storing the product in the warehouse. The error message indicates an issue with the SQL query syntax or database schema.
