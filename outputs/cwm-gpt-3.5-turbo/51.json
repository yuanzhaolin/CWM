We need to correct the SQL query to include the correct column name for the status of the orders.\n\nThe second SQL query to calculate the progress for each unfinished order also resulted in a ProgrammingError. We need to correct the syntax error in the SQL query to properly calculate the progress by summing the completed quantities of sewing tasks and dividing by the total quantity of products in the order.\n\nOnce the SQL queries are corrected and executed successfully, we can compare the progress of all unfinished orders and identify the order with the fastest completion progress by analyzing the calculated progress values for each order."
