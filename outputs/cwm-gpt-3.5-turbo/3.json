Once we have both the total completed quantity and the total quantity, we can then perform the calculation as follows:\n\nProgress Percentage = (Total Completed Quantity / Total Quantity) * 100\n\nPlease correct the SQL query to retrieve the total quantity of products in the order to complete the calculation for the progress percentage."

However, there was a syntax error in the SQL query that prevented us from retrieving the total quantity.\n\nPlease correct the SQL query to include the total quantity of products in the order so we can calculate the progress percentage accurately. Once we have both quantities, we can calculate the progress percentage using the formula:\n\nProgress Percentage = (Total Completed Quantity / Total Quantity) * 100\n\nFeel free to provide the corrected SQL query, and I'll be happy to help you calculate the production progress! üòÑ",
