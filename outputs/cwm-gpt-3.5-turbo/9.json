Now, we need to gather information on the completion status of each sewing task to calculate the progress. \n\nWe can achieve this by querying the database for the completion status of each sewing task ID. Once we have the completion status for each task, we can sum the completed tasks and divide by the total planned tasks to determine the progress of sewing tasks."
