26.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer does not match the standard answer's logical reasoning process. The standard answer provides a detailed breakdown of the original materials with their quantities for each work-in-progress material, while the tested model only lists the original material IDs and their names without the associated quantities. The tested model's response lacks the detailed information required to fully answer the original question.
52.json;False; Wrong calculation; The tested model's answer contains incorrect quantities for the raw materials. The process of summing the quantities of each original material from the work-in-progress materials was not performed correctly, leading to significantly higher quantities than those in the standard answer.
53.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified the cutting task that has started but is not yet completed and calculated the total number of unfinished tasks accurately. The difference in the presentation of the working group (ID instead of name) does not affect the correctness of the answer.
27.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model incorrectly included Task ID 22 as not completed, even though the task is not listed in the standard answer's results. The standard answer only identifies Task ID 33 as pending completion. The tested model's logic in identifying incomplete tasks does not match the standard answer's logic.
34.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer only provides the Task ID without additional details such as Start Time, End Time, and Product ID, which are present in the standard answer. The model's process also lacks the necessary join with the order_product table to retrieve the complete information.
33.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided the correct information about the cutting tasks assigned to the "Precision Cutters" working group, and the additional "Order Product ID" column does not affect the correctness of the response.
51.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model provided a completion progress for each order and identified "William_Skirt_Sweater_Shorts" as having the fastest completion progress. However, the standard answer indicates that there was a technical error in retrieving the progress data, and thus, the fastest completion progress could not be determined. The tested model's process and conclusion do not align with the standard answer's logic and outcome.
9.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model incorrectly summarizes the sewing tasks. It provides a total completed quantity of 585, which is not broken down by individual tasks as in the standard answer. The model's response lacks the detailed task status and incorrectly assumes that the total completed quantity is sufficient to conclude that all tasks are completed without verifying each task's completion status individually.
22.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided the correct list of sewing and cutting groups, and the SQL query used to retrieve the data was appropriate and returned the expected results.
50.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
32.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer contains incorrect data for the "Completed Number" and "Status" fields for some tasks. For example, the completed numbers for tasks 13 and 12 are incorrect, and the status for task 12 is marked as "Completed" instead of "In Progress." The model's process of generating the answer also shows discrepancies in the data retrieved, leading to these inaccuracies.
54.json;False; Wrong calculation; The tested model's answer contains slight discrepancies in the progress percentages compared to the standard answer. The model rounded the percentages differently, leading to minor inaccuracies in the final output.
28.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
8.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model provided a list of original material names without associating them with the specific products and quantities in Olivia's order. The standard answer includes a detailed breakdown of materials by product ID, WIP material ID, original material ID, and quantity, which the tested model failed to provide.
5.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
14.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
11.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model's response includes all the necessary information about the cutting tasks that will be completed before April 30, 2024, and the SQL query used to retrieve this information is correct. The absence of the "Order Product ID" column in the tested model's response does not affect the correctness of the answer, as it was not explicitly required by the original question.
41.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully retrieved the necessary customer and product IDs, created the order, and inserted the correct quantities of each product into the order. The final output matches the expected order details.
15.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
49.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified the planned quantity and the update error, and provided a reasonable suggestion to address the issue.
21.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer incorrectly lists the "Completed Number" for Task ID 22 as 60, whereas the standard answer shows it as 115. The SQL query results indicate that the "Completed Number" should indeed be 115, not 60.
16.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
13.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model's response matches the standard answer in terms of content and organization, and the SQL query used in the generation process correctly retrieves the necessary data.
31.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer does not match the standard answer. The model retrieved incorrect sewing task data, as the task details provided do not correspond to the "Premier Sewers" group. The working group ID used in the final output is incorrect, leading to a mismatch in the task details.
10.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
35.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer includes additional columns "Total Number" and "Left Number" which are not part of the standard answer. The standard answer only requires the "Cutting Task ID" and "Material Name". The tested model's process also includes unnecessary steps to retrieve these additional details, which are not required by the original question.
6.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model retrieved incorrect product details for PolyU's January 2024 orders. The standard answer shows T-shirts with specific attributes and quantities, while the tested model provided details for pants with different attributes and quantities. The process of generating the answer also deviated from the correct logic, as it used a tool to find order details without correctly identifying the order ID for January 2024.
24.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model incorrectly retrieved the product ID and number of items. The standard answer shows the order product ID as 31, while the tested model shows it as 15. Additionally, the tested model's process of generating the answer does not match the standard answer's logic, as it joins with the order_product table, which is not part of the standard answer's process.
25.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model correctly identifies the working group ID for "Master Sewers" but fails to conclude that there are no results for sewing tasks created after February 1, 2024. Instead, it suggests running another query without acknowledging the absence of results, which is a deviation from the standard answer's conclusion.
36.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model included additional columns such as "Planned Number," "Completed Number," and "Status" in its response, which were not part of the standard answer. The standard answer only required the task ID, start time, end time, working group name, and order product ID. The inclusion of extra information indicates a deviation from the expected logic and output format.
47.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
19.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer is incomplete. It only lists two sewing tasks (IDs 6 and 8) that use silk, whereas the standard answer includes a comprehensive list of 14 sewing tasks. The model's process of generating the answer did not retrieve all relevant sewing task IDs associated with the use of silk, leading to an incomplete response.
45.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model provided additional information about the current stock and remaining stock, which was not required by the original question. The standard answer focused solely on confirming the release of 100 units without delving into stock details. The tested model's response deviated from the expected output by including unnecessary details.
43.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
30.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
20.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
23.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified that the "Main Warehouse" has 3400 units of "Cotton Fabric" and that there is no available data for the "Auxiliary Warehouse," which aligns with the standard answer.
38.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer includes an "Order Name" which is not part of the standard answer. The standard answer focuses on "Order ID" and "Customer Name" only. The model's process of generating the answer deviates from the standard logic by retrieving and including the "Order Name" instead of the "Order ID".
4.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer does not include the quantity of each product in James's orders, which is a crucial part of the information provided in the standard answer. The model's process correctly retrieves the necessary data, but the final output omits the quantity details, leading to an incomplete answer.
7.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
29.json;False; Wrong calculation; The tested model incorrectly calculated the remaining workload for the "Master Sewers" workgroup. The standard answer shows that the remaining workload is 0, but the tested model's process incorrectly calculated it as 40. This discrepancy indicates an error in the calculation of the remaining workload.
55.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
1.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model included an incorrect order name "Order20240702120000" instead of "Order for PolyU" in its response. The process of generating the answer retrieved the correct data, but the final output did not match the standard answer.
39.json;False; Else; The tested model's answer contains a minor discrepancy in the status description for Cutting Task ID 27. The standard answer lists the status as "Not Completed," while the tested model lists it as "In Progress." This inconsistency in the status description is the only error, as the rest of the information matches the standard answer.
42.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model correctly identifies the relevant IDs but fails to complete the task by not updating the sewing tasks to "start" status. The standard answer includes this final step, which the tested model omits.
18.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
40.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
12.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer is missing the "Order Product ID" column, which is present in the standard answer. The SQL query used by the tested model did not include the "order_product_id" field, leading to an incomplete response compared to the standard answer.
44.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
2.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer is based on the total and completed quantities of sewing tasks, which is not the same logic used in the standard answer. The standard answer checks the status of both cutting and sewing tasks to determine if all orders are completed. The tested model only considers sewing tasks, leading to a different conclusion about the completion status of the orders.
3.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model incorrectly calculated the overall production progress by summing up the completed dresses and total dresses across all tasks, rather than calculating the progress percentage for each individual sewing task as shown in the standard answer. The correct approach is to calculate the progress percentage for each task separately, not as a total percentage of all tasks combined.
17.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional details (Planned Number, Completed Number, Status) which are not required by the original question but do not affect the correctness of the answer. The core information matches the standard answer.
48.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identifies the task transfer issue due to a SQL syntax error, similar to the standard answer.
37.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model incorrectly identified the task as completed, which contradicts the criteria of the task not being completed. The model's process included retrieving additional details that led to this incorrect conclusion, despite the initial SQL query correctly identifying the task with the highest planned quantity.
46.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully allocated the materials as requested and provided a detailed allocation summary, which aligns with the standard answer.
