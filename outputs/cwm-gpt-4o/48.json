    "gt": "Hello there! 😄\n\nIt looks like you're trying to transfer some tasks from the \"Advanced Sewers\" group to the \"Premier Sewers\" group. Let's see what we have:\n\n### Working Group IDs\n| Working Group       | ID  |\n|---------------------|-----|\n| Advanced Sewers     | 8   |\n| Premier Sewers      | 9   |\n\nUnfortunately, it seems there was an issue with updating the tasks due to a syntax error in the SQL query. 😅 But don't worry, we can still help you out! \n\nTo transfer the tasks, you'll need to update the `cutting_tasks` table by setting the `working_group_id` to `9` for tasks that started between May 1, 2024, and May 30, 2024. Make sure to replace `<cutting_task_ids>` with the actual IDs of the tasks you want to transfer.\n\nIf you need further assistance or have any questions, feel free to ask! 😊",

Let's make sure the task IDs are correctly identified and formatted for the update. If you need further assistance with the SQL query, feel free to ask! 😊",
