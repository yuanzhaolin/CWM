Here's a neat table to show you the details:\n\n| Cutting Task ID | Material Name       |\n|-----------------|---------------------|\n| 8               | Denim Fabric        |\n| 11              | Wool, Silk          |\n| 16              | Wool, Leather, Down |\n| 19              | Cotton Fabric, Synthetic Fiber |\n| 20              | Wool, Leather       |\n| 21              | Cotton Fabric, Synthetic Fiber |\n| 26              | Wool                |\n| 27              | Wool, Leather, Down |\n| 34              | Cotton Fabric, Synthetic Fiber |\n\nI hope this helps!

However, we can list the material names that are potentially allocated to these tasks based on the available material names from Step 4.\n\nHere is the list of material names that could be allocated to the cutting tasks:\n\n- Cotton Fabric\n- Wool\n- Silk\n- Leather\n- Synthetic Fiber\n- Denim Fabric\n- Down\n\nWithout the specific mapping from Step 3, this is the best approximation of the materials allocated to the cutting tasks."
