Here's how we can do it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Retrieve Completed Numbers and WIP Material Requirements:**\n   - From the cutting tasks, we have the following completed numbers:\n     - Task 1: `produced_wip_id` 8, `completed_number` 120\n     - Task 2: `produced_wip_id` 10, `completed_number` 0\n     - Task 3: `produced_wip_id` 2, `completed_number` 0\n\n   - The WIP material requirements are:\n     - `wip_id` 8: \n       - `origin_material_id` 9, `number` 0.6\n       - `origin_material_id` 1, `number` 0.35\n       - `origin_material_id` 13, `number` 0.8\n     - `wip_id` 10:\n       - `origin_material_id` 1, `number` 0.4\n       - `origin_material_id` 11, `number` 0.65\n       - `origin_material_id` 3, `number` 0.2\n     - `wip_id` 2:\n       - `origin_material_id` 7, `number` 1.0\n       - `origin_material_id` 9, `number` 0.2\n       - `origin_material_id` 5, `number` 0.1\n\n2. **Calculate Total Used Quantities:**\n   - For `produced_wip_id` 8 (completed number 120):\n     - Material 9: 120 * 0.6 = 72\n     - Material 1: 120 * 0.35 = 42\n     - Material 13: 120 * 0.8 = 96\n\n   - For `produced_wip_id` 10 (completed number 0):\n     - Material 1: 0 * 0.4 = 0\n     - Material 11: 0 * 0.65 = 0\n     - Material 3: 0 * 0.2 = 0\n\n   - For `produced_wip_id` 2 (completed number 0):\n     - Material 7: 0 * 1.0 = 0\n     - Material 9: 0 * 0.2 = 0\n     - Material 5: 0 * 0.1 = 0\n\n3. **Sum Up Quantities for Each Material:**\n   - Material 9: 72 + 0 = 72\n   - Material 1: 42 + 0 = 42\n   - Material 13: 96\n   - Material 11: 0\n   - Material 3: 0\n   - Material 7: 0\n   - Material 5: 0\n\nThus, the total used quantities for each material are:\n- Material 9: 72\n- Material 1: 42\n- Material 13: 96\n- Material 11: 0\n- Material 3: 0\n- Material 7: 0\n- Material 5: 0"
