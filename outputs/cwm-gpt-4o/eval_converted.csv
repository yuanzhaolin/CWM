1.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided the correct order names for PolyU, and the SQL queries used to retrieve the data were executed successfully. The absence of order IDs in the final answer does not affect the correctness of the response."
2.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model only considered the status of sewing tasks to determine if John's orders were completed, while the standard answer considered both cutting and sewing tasks. The conclusion that not all orders are completed is correct, but the reasoning process is incomplete as it ignores the cutting tasks."
3.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model calculated the overall production progress for all sewing tasks combined, rather than providing the progress percentage for each individual sewing task as specified in the standard answer. The conclusion of the tested model is different from the standard answer, which breaks down the progress for each task separately."
4.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided the correct product details for James's orders, including additional product IDs, which is acceptable."
5.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
6.json,FALSE,Wrong understanding,The tested model misunderstood the original question by focusing on an order named "James_WinterOrder" instead of retrieving the products included in PolyU's January 2024 orders. This led to an incorrect process and answer.
7.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
8.json,FALSE,Wrong understanding,"The tested model's answer does not match the standard answer.

10.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified the unfinished products, their types, attributes, and quantities, matching the standard answer."
11.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided the correct conclusion and relevant data, even though it omitted the ""Order Product ID"" column, which does not affect the correctness of the answer."
12.json,TRUE,,"The tested model's answer includes the correct tasks that will be completed before May 31, 2024, and provides additional information about the planned and completed numbers. The inclusion of extra details does not contradict the original question and is therefore acceptable."
13.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided the correct list of raw materials with non-zero inventory, and the process used to generate the answer was valid and aligned with the standard answer."
14.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified ""Silk Pieces"" as the material with the highest remaining inventory, and the conclusion matches the standard answer. The process used by the tested model, although different, still led to the correct result."
15.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified the material with the lowest remaining inventory as ""Silk"" and provided the material ID and name, which aligns with the standard answer."
16.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
17.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional details (Planned Number, Completed Number, Status) which are not present in the standard answer, but the core information matches the standard answer."
18.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
19.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional information (Product ID and Number) which is not present in the standard answer, but it does not contradict the required information and includes all necessary details."

21.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
22.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly retrieves and presents the sewing and cutting groups, matching the standard answer."
23.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified that the Main Warehouse has 3500 units of Cotton Fabric, while the Auxiliary Warehouse has none, and concluded that the Main Warehouse has more Cotton Fabric."
24.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model used an incorrect SQL query to retrieve tasks with an end time before June 30, 2024, instead of a start time. However, the final answer coincidentally matches the standard answer because the task's start time also falls within the required range."
25.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
26.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
27.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified the tasks that have not been completed by the ""Advanced Sewers"" working group, and the data provided matches the standard answer. The omission of the ""Start Time"" and ""End Time"" columns does not affect the correctness of the answer."

30.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
31.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model's response matches the standard answer in terms of data and conclusion, and the process used to generate the answer is also consistent with the standard process. The only minor difference is the emoji used for ""Not Started"" status, which does not affect the correctness of the answer."
32.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model's response matches the standard answer in terms of content and logic, and the SQL queries used to generate the answer are also correct. The slight difference in formatting (use of emojis) does not affect the correctness of the answer."

35.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional information (allocated quantity) which is not required by the original question but does not contradict the correctness of the answer.
36.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided the correct cutting tasks for the customer ""PolyU"" and included all necessary details, even though it used working group IDs instead of names. This difference in format does not affect the correctness of the answer."

42.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
43.json,FALSE,Else,"The tested model's response indicates an issue with storing the materials, which is not present in the standard answer. The standard answer assumes successful storage, while the tested model suggests a problem occurred, leading to a discrepancy in the final conclusion."
44.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully stored 100 units of the product with ID=15 in the Auxiliary warehouse and provided a summary of the operation, which aligns with the standard answer."
45.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully released 100 units of Cotton Fabric from the Main Warehouse and provided a summary of the operation, which aligns with the original request. The absence of the ""Units Remaining"" information does not affect the correctness of the response."
46.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model's response matches the standard answer in terms of content and allocation details, and the SQL queries used in the generation process are valid and achieve the intended result."
47.json,FALSE,Wrong calculation,"The tested model failed to correctly identify and use the WIP material IDs necessary for creating the cutting tasks. As a result, it could not generate the tasks successfully, leading to an incorrect conclusion that the tasks could not be created due to missing information. The standard answer shows that the necessary WIP material IDs were available and used correctly to create the tasks."
48.json,FALSE,Wrong syntax,"The model attempted to update tasks with an empty list of task IDs, resulting in a SQL syntax error. The error occurred because the model did not handle the case where no tasks were found to transfer, leading to an incorrect SQL update statement."
