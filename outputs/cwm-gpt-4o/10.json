Order Product ID 23 - Completed Quantity: 80\n3. Order Product ID 24 - Completed Quantity: 105\n\nTo identify the products where the completed quantity is less than the ordered quantity, we need to match the order product IDs with the product IDs and compare the quantities:\n\n- Product ID 25 (Sweater, Blue, S size): Ordered 115, Completed 60\n  - Completed quantity (60) is less than ordered quantity (115).\n\n- Product ID 8 (Shorts, Silver, S size): Ordered 110, Completed 80\n  - Completed quantity (80) is less than ordered quantity (110).\n\n- Product ID 16 (Shorts, Grey, XL size): Ordered 105, Completed 105\n  - Completed quantity (105) is equal to ordered quantity (105).\n\nThus, the products where the completed quantity is less than the ordered quantity are:\n1.
