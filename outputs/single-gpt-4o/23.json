Here's what we found:\n\n| Warehouse Name   | Cotton Fabric Quantity |\n|------------------|------------------------|\n| Main Warehouse   | 3500                   |\n\nIt seems that the 'Main Warehouse' has 3500 units of 'Cotton Fabric'. Unfortunately, we don't have data for the 'Auxiliary Warehouse', so it looks like the 'Main Warehouse' is leading in this case! ðŸŽ‰\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š",
