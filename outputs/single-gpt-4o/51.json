The order with the highest combined progress percentage (cutting + sewing) would be the one you're looking for.\n\nIf you have access to the database, you might want to check the query for any syntax issues or consult with a database administrator to resolve the error. Once the query is fixed, you should be able to get the desired results! 📊\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! 😊",
