Let's break it down:\n\n### Order Details\n| Product Type | Color | Size | Quantity |\n|--------------|-------|------|----------|\n| T-shirt      | Red   | M    | 50       |\n| Sweater      | Blue  | XL   | 30       |\n\nUnfortunately, there was an issue with the product IDs, which means the order couldn't be completed as expected. It seems like the product details might not be matching exactly with what's in the system. 🤔\n\nCould you please double-check the product details or let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with? I'm here to help! 😊",
