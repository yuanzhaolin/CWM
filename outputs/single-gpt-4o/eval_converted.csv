2.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly determined that not all of John's orders have been completed and provided a valid summary.
3.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model's answer indicates that the production progress of the Dress ordered by Emily is 100%, which contradicts the standard answer. The standard answer provides a detailed breakdown of progress percentages for each sewing task, none of which are fully completed at 100%. The tested model's logic incorrectly aggregates the progress, leading to an incorrect conclusion."
4.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model's answer does not match the standard answer in terms of the product details for James's orders. The model provided product IDs and attributes, but it did not include the order IDs or quantities, which are present in the standard answer. Additionally, the product details do not match those in the standard answer."
5.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
6.json,FALSE,Wrong understanding,The tested model misunderstood the original question by focusing on an order named "James_WinterOrder" instead of retrieving products from PolyU's January 2024 orders. This led to an incorrect SQL query and an incorrect conclusion that no products were found.
7.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
8.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model's answer does not match the standard answer in terms of the materials used in Olivia's order. The standard answer provides a detailed breakdown of materials with specific IDs and quantities, while the tested model only lists general material names without any specific details or quantities."
9.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly calculated the progress percentage of sewing tasks for William as 100%, which aligns with the conclusion of the standard answer that all tasks are completed."
10.json,FALSE,Information Deviation,"The tested model incorrectly concluded that there are no unfinished products for the order ""Michael_SweaterAndShorts"". The SQL query used by the model did not return any results, which led to the incorrect conclusion. The standard answer shows that there are indeed unfinished products, indicating that the model failed to retrieve the correct information."
11.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model's answer includes tasks with a status of 1, which indicates they are not completed, whereas the standard answer only includes tasks with a status of 2, indicating completion. The tested model's SQL query did not filter by status, leading to the inclusion of tasks that are not completed."
12.json,TRUE,,"The tested model's answer includes all the necessary information about the sewing tasks that will be completed before May 31, 2024. Although it provides additional details such as start time, working group ID, planned number, completed number, and status, the core information matches the standard answer. The SQL query used by the tested model is also correct, and the results align with the expected output."
13.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,The tested model's answer does not match the standard answer. The model incorrectly aggregated the remaining quantities by material type ('WIP' and 'Origin') instead of listing individual raw materials with their specific remaining quantities. The logic used in the SQL query and the resulting output do not align with the expected detailed breakdown of each material type and its remaining quantity.
14.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
15.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
16.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided the correct cutting tasks that start after May 1, 2024, and included additional details, which is acceptable."
17.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional details, but the core information matches the standard answer."
18.json,FALSE,Information Deviation,The tested model's answer includes additional cutting task IDs (31 and 34) that are not present in the standard answer. This indicates a deviation in the information retrieved or processed.
19.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model only provided the sewing task IDs without the additional details such as start time, end time, and working group name, which are present in the standard answer. The conclusion is correct, but the model's response lacks the complete information required by the standard answer."
20.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
21.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model included a task (Task ID 25) that falls outside the specified date range of April to May 2024. The task ends in June 2024, which does not align with the original question's requirements."
22.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided the correct list of sewing and cutting groups, and its SQL query successfully retrieved the necessary information. The format of the answer is slightly different but still correct and informative."
23.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified that the Main Warehouse has 3500 units of Cotton Fabric and provided a valid SQL query to retrieve this information. The absence of data for the Auxiliary Warehouse is implicitly handled by the query, which only returns results for the Main Warehouse."
24.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided the correct information about the sewing tasks assigned to the ""Elite Sewers"" before June 30, 2024, and the SQL query used to retrieve the data was also correct."
25.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
26.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model's answer does not align with the standard answer's logical reasoning process. The standard answer provides a detailed breakdown of work-in-progress and original material IDs with quantities, while the tested model provides a list of raw material names without the specific details required."
27.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model included task ID 25 in its response, which is not present in the standard answer. Task ID 25 is marked as completed in the standard answer's SQL results, indicating it should not be included in the list of incomplete tasks. The model's logic for determining incomplete tasks is incorrect."
28.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly determined that not all sewing tasks have been completed, which aligns with the conclusion of the standard answer. The model used a different approach to reach the same conclusion, which is acceptable."
29.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
30.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
31.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided a detailed breakdown of the sewing tasks for the ""Premier Sewers"" working group, which matches the standard answer in terms of content and conclusion. The slight difference in format (absence of ""Order Product ID"" column) does not affect the correctness of the answer."
32.json,FALSE,Information Deviation,"The tested model's answer includes ""Working Group ID"" instead of ""Working Group Name,"" which deviates from the standard answer. The model failed to retrieve the working group names, which are essential for a complete and correct response."

34.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided the correct task details completed by the ""Master Cutters"" team, even though it omitted the product ID, which is acceptable as per the evaluation criteria."
35.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional information (allocated quantity) which is not required by the original question but does not contradict the required information.
36.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided the correct cutting tasks for the customer ""PolyU"" and included additional details such as Working Group ID, Order Product ID, and Produced WIP ID, which are not present in the standard answer but do not contradict it."
37.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model's answer only identifies Task ID 5 as having the highest planned quantity, while the standard answer correctly identifies both Task ID 5 and Task ID 31 as having the highest planned quantity of 260. The tested model's SQL query limits the result to one task, which leads to missing the tie situation."
38.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
39.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model provided only the cutting task IDs without the detailed information such as start time, end time, working group ID, order product ID, produced WIP ID, planned number, completed number, and status, which were included in the standard answer. The conclusion is correct, but the level of detail does not match the standard answer."
40.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided the correct cutting tasks for products categorized as ""T-shirt"" and included additional information about the status, which is acceptable."

43.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model's response indicates that it updated the existing inventory by adding 1000 units of Leather to the Main Warehouse, whereas the standard answer suggests inserting a new entry to store the materials. The logic and approach used by the tested model differ from the standard answer, which aims to keep existing records unchanged."
44.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully updated the inventory to store 100 units of the product with ID=15 in the 'Auxiliary warehouse', and the summary provided is consistent with the operation performed."
45.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully updated the inventory and provided a summary of the action taken, which aligns with the request to release 100 units of cotton fabric from the Main warehouse. The model's response, while slightly different in format, still conveys the correct information and outcome."
46.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully allocated the materials and provided a correct summary of the allocation.
47.json,FALSE,Wrong syntax,"The model's SQL query resulted in an error due to a missing default value for the 'produced_wip_id' field, which prevented the creation of the cutting tasks."
48.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully transferred the tasks and provided a correct summary of the update, even though the format is slightly different from the standard answer."

51.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model incorrectly identifies ""Sophia_SkirtAndJacket"" as the order with the fastest completion progress. The standard answer shows multiple orders with a progress of 1.0000, indicating a tie for the fastest completion progress. The tested model's logic only identifies one order, which does not align with the standard answer's conclusion."
52.json,FALSE,Wrong syntax,"The SQL query execution did not return any results, indicating a possible issue with the query or the database setup. The model incorrectly concluded that there were no results available, which contradicts the standard answer that provides specific quantities for raw materials."
53.json,FALSE,Wrong syntax,"The tested model's response indicates a critical issue was discovered, but it does not provide any relevant information or results related to the original question. The absence of a valid answer suggests a failure in the process, likely due to a syntax or execution error."
54.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model's answer contains an incorrect progress percentage for the ""Elite Sewers"" group. The standard answer shows 44.0678% for ""Elite Sewers,"" but the tested model incorrectly states it as 100.00%. This discrepancy indicates a mistake in the calculation or data retrieval process."
