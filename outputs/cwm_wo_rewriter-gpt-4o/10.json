Product ID 25 (Sweater, Blue, S size) - Ordered Quantity: 115\n2. Product ID 8 (Shorts, Silver, S size) - Ordered Quantity: 110\n3. Product ID 16 (Shorts, Grey, XL size) - Ordered Quantity: 105\n\nFrom Step 4, we have the completed quantities for each product:\n1. Order Product ID 22 - Completed Quantity: 60\n2. Order Product ID 23 - Completed Quantity: 80\n3. Order Product ID 24 - Completed Quantity: 105\n\nNow, we need to match these completed quantities with the ordered quantities and identify where the completed quantity is less than the ordered quantity. However, we need to map the order product IDs from Step 4 to the product IDs from Step 3. Assuming the mapping is as follows based on the order they appear:\n\n- Order Product ID 22 corresponds to Product ID 25 (Sweater)\n- Order Product ID 23 corresponds to Product ID 8 (Shorts, Silver)\n- Order Product ID 24 corresponds to Product ID 16 (Shorts, Grey)\n\nComparing the quantities:\n1. Product ID 25 (Sweater): Ordered Quantity = 115, Completed Quantity = 60\n   - Completed quantity is less than ordered quantity.\n\n2. Product ID 8 (Shorts, Silver): Ordered Quantity = 110, Completed Quantity = 80\n   - Completed quantity is less than ordered quantity.\n\n3. Product ID 16 (Shorts, Grey): Ordered Quantity = 105, Completed Quantity = 105\n   - Completed quantity is equal to ordered quantity.\n\nTherefore, the products where the completed quantity is less than the ordered quantity are:\n- Product ID 25 (Sweater)\n- Product ID 8 (Shorts, Silver)"
