1.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional information (Created At) which is acceptable as it does not contradict the standard answer.
2.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model's conclusion that Order ID 2 is completed and Order ID 10 is not completed contradicts the standard answer, which indicates that both orders have incomplete tasks. The tested model's logic only considers sewing tasks, while the standard answer considers both cutting and sewing tasks, leading to a different conclusion."
3.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model calculated an overall production progress percentage for all dresses ordered by Emily, rather than providing a breakdown of progress for each sewing task as in the standard answer. The conclusion of the tested model is different from the standard answer, which provides detailed progress for each task."

10.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
11.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model's answer includes tasks that are not marked as completed (status = 2) in the SQL query. The standard answer only includes tasks with a status of 2, indicating completion, while the tested model's answer includes all tasks with an end time before April 30, 2024, regardless of their completion status."
12.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model's answer includes additional columns such as ""Completed Number,"" ""Order Product Quantity,"" ""Product Attributes,"" and ""Product Type,"" which are not present in the standard answer. Moreover, the tested model's answer only includes a subset of the tasks listed in the standard answer, missing many tasks that should be completed before May 31, 2024. The SQL query used by the tested model also filters tasks by status, which is not part of the standard answer's logic."
13.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model's response matches the standard answer in terms of content and format, and the SQL query used to generate the answer is also correct."

32.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model's answer includes different columns compared to the standard answer, such as ""Working Group ID"" and ""Order Product ID"" instead of ""Working Group Name."" Additionally, the status is presented as ""Complete"" instead of ""Completed,"" which deviates from the standard answer's format. The model's process also lacks the step to join with the working group table to retrieve the working group names, leading to a discrepancy in the final output."
33.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional details about the products, which is acceptable as it still includes the correct task information."
34.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model's answer only provides the Task ID without additional details such as Start Time, End Time, and Product ID, which are present in the standard answer. The model's process also lacks the necessary join to retrieve these additional details."
35.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional information (allocated quantity) which is not required by the original question but does not contradict the required information.
36.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model provided additional information about product attributes and product types, which were not part of the standard answer. The standard answer focused on task details such as planned and completed numbers and status, which the tested model did not include. The conclusion of the tested model's answer does not match the standard answer's conclusion."
37.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model's answer only includes Task ID 5 with a planned quantity of 260, while the standard answer identifies both Task ID 5 and Task ID 31 as having the highest planned quantity of 260. The tested model's SQL query limits the result to only one task, which leads to an incomplete answer."
38.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
39.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided the correct cutting tasks that use ""Leather"" and included additional details such as the working group name, which is acceptable."
40.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The order of the tasks in the table is different, but the content is the same, which is acceptable."

The process of generating the answer involved correct SQL queries to update the inventory, and the final response aligns with the expected outcome."
46.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
47.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model's response indicates that no cutting tasks were created due to missing WIP material data, which contradicts the standard answer where cutting tasks were successfully created. The model's process also shows an incorrect order ID and failed SQL operations, leading to no tasks being generated."
48.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully transferred the tasks and provided a summary, which aligns with the standard answer."
49.json,TRUE,,Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully updated the completed quantity to match the planned number and provided a correct summary of the update.
50.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully updated the expected completion date for cutting task 33 to July 31, 2024, and confirmed the update in its response. The difference in the level of detail compared to the standard answer does not affect the correctness of the response."
51.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model incorrectly identifies ""James_WinterOrder"" as the single order with the fastest completion progress, while the standard answer shows multiple orders with the same highest progress of 1.0000. The model's logic in selecting only one order is flawed, as it does not account for all orders with the same maximum progress."
52.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model's answer does not match the standard answer in terms of the raw materials and quantities used. The model's process involves calculating the total used quantity for each raw material directly from product materials, which differs from the standard answer's process of calculating based on original materials derived from work-in-progress materials."
53.json,FALSE,Wrong COT,"The tested model's answer includes tasks that are already completed (unfinished quantity is 0), which should not be listed as unfinished tasks. The standard answer correctly identifies only the task with ID 32 as unfinished. The total number of unfinished tasks is correctly calculated as 27, but the list of tasks is incorrect."
54.json,FALSE,Wrong calculation,"The tested model incorrectly calculated the progress percentage for the ""Elite Sewers"" group. The correct progress percentage should be 44.0678%, but the model provided 100.00%. This discrepancy indicates an error in the calculation process."
55.json,TRUE,,"Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided the correct top three products with their descriptions, attributes, and total quantities, matching the standard answer."
