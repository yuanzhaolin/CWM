Here's what we found:\n\n| Warehouse          | Cotton Fabric Quantity |\n|--------------------|------------------------|\n| Main Warehouse     | 3500                   |\n| Auxiliary Warehouse| No data available      |\n\nBased on the information, it seems like the **Main Warehouse** has 3500 units of Cotton Fabric, while we couldn't find any data for the Auxiliary Warehouse. So, the Main Warehouse takes the lead! 🏆\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! 😊",
