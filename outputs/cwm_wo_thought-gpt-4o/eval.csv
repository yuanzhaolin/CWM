54.json;False; Wrong calculation; The tested model incorrectly calculated the progress percentage for the "Elite Sewers" group. The correct progress percentage should be 44.0678%, but the model provided 100.00%. This discrepancy indicates an error in the calculation process.
49.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully updated the completed quantity to match the planned number and provided a correct summary of the update.
29.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified "Master Sewers" as the workgroup with the highest remaining workload and provided a valid summary of the results.
18.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model included additional cutting tasks (IDs 31 and 34) that were not present in the standard answer. The process of generating the answer also retrieved incorrect cutting task IDs, leading to a deviation from the expected result.
6.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the original question, which asked for products included in PolyU's January 2024 orders. Instead, it provided details for an order named "James_WinterOrder," which is not relevant to the original query. Additionally, the model's process included a failed SQL query, indicating a misunderstanding of the task requirements.
42.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
40.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The order of the tasks in the table is different, but the content is the same, which is acceptable.
19.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional information (Order Product ID) which is not required by the original question but does not contradict the correct answer.
52.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer does not match the standard answer in terms of the raw materials and quantities used. The model's process involves calculating the total used quantity for each raw material directly from product materials, which differs from the standard answer's process of calculating based on original materials derived from work-in-progress materials.
36.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model provided additional information about product attributes and product types, which were not part of the standard answer. The standard answer focused on task details such as planned and completed numbers and status, which the tested model did not include. The conclusion of the tested model's answer does not match the standard answer's conclusion.
16.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional details (Product Attributes and Product Type) which are not present in the standard answer, but the core information required by the original question is correct.
15.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified "Silk" as the material with the lowest remaining inventory, and the SQL query used was appropriate to retrieve this information. The answer, although more concise, still provides the correct material name.
37.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer only includes Task ID 5 with a planned quantity of 260, while the standard answer identifies both Task ID 5 and Task ID 31 as having the highest planned quantity of 260. The tested model's SQL query limits the result to only one task, which leads to an incomplete answer.
20.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
39.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided the correct cutting tasks that use "Leather" and included additional details such as the working group name, which is acceptable.
35.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional information (allocated quantity) which is not required by the original question but does not contradict the required information.
25.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
28.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identifies that not all sewing tasks have been completed, which aligns with the conclusion of the standard answer. The process used by the tested model is also valid, as it checks for any sewing tasks that are not completed.
50.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully updated the expected completion date for cutting task 33 to July 31, 2024, and confirmed the update in its response. The difference in the level of detail compared to the standard answer does not affect the correctness of the response.
9.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided a summary of the sewing tasks for William, indicating that all tasks are completed with a 100% progress, which aligns with the conclusion of the standard answer. The model used a different approach to aggregate the data but arrived at the correct conclusion.
23.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
38.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
5.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.

14.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
27.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer includes tasks that have already been completed, as indicated by the completed numbers matching the planned numbers. The model failed to filter out these completed tasks, leading to an incorrect list of tasks that are not yet completed.
51.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model incorrectly identifies "James_WinterOrder" as the single order with the fastest completion progress, while the standard answer shows multiple orders with the same highest progress of 1.0000. The model's logic in selecting only one order is flawed, as it does not account for all orders with the same maximum progress.
32.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer includes different columns compared to the standard answer, such as "Working Group ID" and "Order Product ID" instead of "Working Group Name." Additionally, the status is presented as "Complete" instead of "Completed," which deviates from the standard answer's format. The model's process also lacks the step to join with the working group table to retrieve the working group names, leading to a discrepancy in the final output.
8.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer does not match the standard answer in terms of the materials and quantities used in Olivia's order. The tested model provided a list of material names and quantities that do not correspond to the original materials and quantities specified in the standard answer. The process of generating the answer also deviated from the standard answer's logic, as it did not correctly retrieve and map the original materials for each work-in-progress material.
34.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer only provides the Task ID without additional details such as Start Time, End Time, and Product ID, which are present in the standard answer. The model's process also lacks the necessary join to retrieve these additional details.
31.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model's response matches the standard answer in terms of data and conclusion, despite minor differences in wording and symbols used for status.
7.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer states that there are 2 orders in total for PolyU, which contradicts the standard answer's conclusion of 3 orders. The process of generating the answer also aligns with the incorrect conclusion.
21.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model included a task (Task ID 25) that falls outside the specified date range of April to May 2024. The task with ID 25 has a start time of May 14, 2024, and an end time of June 3, 2024, which extends beyond the requested period. Additionally, the model's output format differs from the standard answer by including "Product ID" and "Quantity" instead of "Planned Number," "Completed Number," and "Status."
24.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional details about the product, which is acceptable as it still includes the correct task information.
11.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer includes tasks that are not marked as completed (status = 2) in the SQL query. The standard answer only includes tasks with a status of 2, indicating completion, while the tested model's answer includes all tasks with an end time before April 30, 2024, regardless of their completion status.
45.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully released 100 units of Cotton Fabric from the Main Warehouse and provided a correct summary of the action taken. The process of generating the answer involved correct SQL queries to update the inventory, and the final response aligns with the expected outcome.
47.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's response indicates that no cutting tasks were created due to missing WIP material data, which contradicts the standard answer where cutting tasks were successfully created. The model's process also shows an incorrect order ID and failed SQL operations, leading to no tasks being generated.
13.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model's response matches the standard answer in terms of content and format, and the SQL query used to generate the answer is also correct.
30.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
3.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model calculated an overall production progress percentage for all dresses ordered by Emily, rather than providing a breakdown of progress for each sewing task as in the standard answer. The conclusion of the tested model is different from the standard answer, which provides detailed progress for each task.
48.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully transferred the tasks and provided a summary, which aligns with the standard answer.
12.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer includes additional columns such as "Completed Number," "Order Product Quantity," "Product Attributes," and "Product Type," which are not present in the standard answer. Moreover, the tested model's answer only includes a subset of the tasks listed in the standard answer, missing many tasks that should be completed before May 31, 2024. The SQL query used by the tested model also filters tasks by status, which is not part of the standard answer's logic.
4.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided the correct product details for James's orders, including additional information such as Product ID, which is acceptable.
17.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional details about the sewing tasks, which is acceptable as it includes the correct information required by the original question.
41.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided a correct summary of the order details, including the customer name, order date, order ID, products ordered, and quantities, which aligns with the standard answer. The generation process also correctly executed the necessary SQL queries to retrieve and insert the required data.
26.json;False; Wrong understanding; The tested model misunderstood the original question, which asked for the raw materials used by the "Skilled Sewers" in terms of original material IDs and quantities. Instead, the model provided a list of material names without the required details about original material IDs and quantities, which does not align with the standard answer.
46.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
53.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer includes tasks that are already completed (unfinished quantity is 0), which should not be listed as unfinished tasks. The standard answer correctly identifies only the task with ID 32 as unfinished. The total number of unfinished tasks is correctly calculated as 27, but the list of tasks is incorrect.
22.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided the correct sewing and cutting groups, albeit in a different format, which is acceptable.
43.json;False; Else; The tested model's response indicates an issue with storing the materials, which is not present in the standard answer. The standard answer successfully stores the materials without any issues. The tested model's response introduces an unnecessary complication that is not supported by the provided data or process.
10.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
33.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional details about the products, which is acceptable as it still includes the correct task information.
2.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's conclusion that Order ID 2 is completed and Order ID 10 is not completed contradicts the standard answer, which indicates that both orders have incomplete tasks. The tested model's logic only considers sewing tasks, while the standard answer considers both cutting and sewing tasks, leading to a different conclusion.
55.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided the correct top three products with their descriptions, attributes, and total quantities, matching the standard answer.
44.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
