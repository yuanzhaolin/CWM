26.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
52.json;False; Wrong calculation; The tested model failed to correctly aggregate the quantities of each original material used. It listed the quantities for each work-in-progress material instead of summing them up to get the total used quantity for each original material, as shown in the standard answer.
53.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
27.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model incorrectly included Task ID 22 as a task that has not been completed. According to the SQL query results, Task ID 22 has a completed number of 60, which is not equal to the planned number of 115, indicating it is still in progress. However, the standard answer only considers tasks with a completed number of 0 as not completed, which is the case for Task ID 33. The model's logic for determining incomplete tasks does not align with the standard answer's logic.
34.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer only provides the Task ID without additional details such as start time, end time, and product ID, which are present in the standard answer. The model's process also lacks the necessary SQL join to retrieve these additional details.
33.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer includes incorrect columns "Product ID" and "Number of Products" instead of "Planned Number", "Completed Number", and "Status". The model's process also incorrectly joins the "order_product" table, which is not part of the standard answer's logic.
51.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model incorrectly identified "PolyU_Skirt" as having the fastest completion progress among unfinished orders. The standard answer indicates that there was a technical error in retrieving the progress data, and no specific order was identified as having the fastest progress. The tested model's process of generating the answer did not account for this error and incorrectly provided a completion progress of 100% for "PolyU_Skirt," which contradicts the standard answer's conclusion.
9.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer does not match the standard answer's logical reasoning process. The model incorrectly aggregates the sewing tasks into a single order summary, whereas the standard answer provides a detailed breakdown of each task. The model's approach leads to a loss of detailed information about individual tasks.
22.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided the correct list of sewing and cutting groups, and its SQL query accurately retrieved the necessary data. The format of the answer is slightly different but still conveys the same information as the standard answer.
50.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
32.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer does not match the standard answer in terms of the logic and data presented. The completed numbers and statuses for tasks 11, 12, and 13 are incorrect. The model's process retrieved different data for the completed numbers and statuses, leading to discrepancies in the final output.
54.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly calculated the progress percentages for all sewing groups and presented them in a table format, matching the standard answer.
28.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified that not all sewing tasks have been completed and provided a summary that aligns with the standard answer.
8.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer does not match the standard answer's logical reasoning process. The model provided a list of material names without associating them with specific products, WIP material IDs, or quantities, which are essential details in the standard answer.
5.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
14.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
11.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.

15.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer does not include the remaining inventory quantity, which is part of the standard answer. The process of generating the answer also lacks the step to retrieve the remaining inventory quantity.
49.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified the error in the SQL update process and provided an accurate description of the issue, similar to the standard answer.
21.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer incorrectly lists the "Completed Number" for Task ID 22 as 60, while the standard answer shows it as 115. The SQL query results in the tested model's process show the "completed_number" for Task ID 22 as 115, indicating that the model did not correctly interpret or present the data from the query results.
16.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
13.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
31.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer incorrectly lists the "Completed Number" for Task ID 11 as 100 instead of 140, and the status for Task ID 26 as "Completed" instead of "In Progress". The SQL query results show the correct "Completed Number" and status, indicating an error in the model's interpretation or presentation of the data.
10.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
35.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
6.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model retrieved incorrect order details for PolyU's January 2024 orders. It provided details for a different order named "James_WinterOrder" instead of the correct order. The process of generating the answer did not follow the correct logical steps to identify the correct order and its associated products.
24.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model incorrectly retrieved the "Product ID" as 15 instead of the correct "Order Product ID" which is 31. Additionally, the tested model omitted the "Planned Number," "Completed Number," and "Status" fields that were present in the standard answer.
25.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model correctly identifies the working group ID for "Master Sewers" but fails to complete the process by checking for sewing tasks created after February 1, 2024. The standard answer indicates that there are no results for such tasks, but the tested model does not reach this conclusion.
36.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model included additional columns such as "Planned Number", "Completed Number", and "Status" in its response, which were not part of the standard answer. The original question only asked for cutting tasks, not for additional details about the tasks' progress or completion status. The inclusion of these extra details indicates a deviation from the expected logic and focus of the response.
47.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified the issue with the missing default value for the 'produced_wip_id' field and provided a summary of the information obtained, which matches the standard answer.
19.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model only provided the sewing task IDs associated with "Silk" but did not include the detailed information for each task as presented in the standard answer. The standard answer includes additional details such as start time, end time, working group ID, order product ID, planned number, completed number, and status for each sewing task, which the tested model failed to provide.
45.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model provided additional information about the current stock and remaining stock after release, which was not required by the original question. The original question only asked for the release of 100 units, not for a stock check or remaining stock calculation. The model's response deviates from the standard answer's logic by including unnecessary details.
43.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer does not include the necessary step of inserting a new entry with the material type ID and warehouse ID to store the materials, which is a crucial part of the standard answer's logic.
30.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
20.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
23.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
38.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer includes "Order Name" instead of "Order ID," which does not match the format of the standard answer. The standard answer provides "Order ID" and "Customer Name," while the tested model provides "Customer Name" and "Order Name." The logic in the generation process is correct, but the final output format does not align with the standard answer.
4.json;False; Wrong calculation; The tested model's answer contains incorrect quantities for the products. The quantities for each product do not match the standard answer, indicating an error in the calculation or retrieval of the product quantities.
7.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
29.json;False; Wrong calculation; The tested model's answer indicates that the "Master Sewers" have a remaining workload of 40, which contradicts the standard answer's result of 0. The discrepancy arises from the SQL query results in the tested model's process, where the total completed number for "Master Sewers" is incorrectly listed as 1220 instead of 1260, leading to an incorrect calculation of the remaining workload.
55.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model's response matches the standard answer in terms of content and logic, and it correctly retrieves and presents the top three products made in all orders.
1.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model included an incorrect order name "Order20240702120000" which does not match the standard answer. The standard answer lists "Order for PolyU" as the correct order name. The model's process of generating the answer retrieved the correct data but failed to present it accurately in the final response.
39.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's process for generating the answer deviates from the standard answer's logic. The model incorrectly retrieves cutting task IDs based on WIP material IDs instead of using warehouse material IDs associated with "Leather." This leads to an incorrect list of cutting task IDs.
42.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model correctly identified the necessary details and set the sewing tasks to start status, matching the standard answer.
18.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's answer includes incorrect cutting task IDs that do not match the standard answer. The process used by the tested model retrieves cutting task IDs based on the produced WIP ID, which does not accurately reflect the cutting tasks using "Cotton Fabric" as a material. The standard answer correctly identifies cutting tasks by checking the allocation of the warehouse material "Cotton Fabric," leading to a different set of task IDs.
40.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional information (Product ID) which is not required by the original question but does not affect the correctness of the answer.
12.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional details (attributes and description) which are not required by the original question but do not affect the correctness of the answer. The core information about the sewing tasks completed before May 31, 2024, is accurate and matches the standard answer.
44.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
2.json;False; Wrong syntax; The model's answer contains an error message indicating a SQL syntax issue: "Unknown column 'o.id' in 'field list'". This error occurred in the final SQL query step, which affected the model's ability to correctly determine the completion status of John's orders.
3.json;False; Wrong calculation; The tested model calculated the overall progress percentage by summing up the completed numbers and dividing by the sum of planned numbers, which is incorrect. The correct approach is to calculate the progress percentage for each sewing task individually, as shown in the standard answer.
17.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model provided additional details (Planned Number, Completed Number, Status) which were not requested but do not affect the correctness of the answer. The core information matches the standard answer.
48.json;False; Wrong COT; The tested model's response does not address the issue of transferring tasks due to a syntax error in the SQL query, as highlighted in the standard answer. The model's response assumes the task transfer is successful without acknowledging the SQL error or providing guidance on how to correct it.
37.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct.
46.json;True;; Both the answer and the process of generating the answer are correct. The tested model successfully allocated the materials as requested and provided a correct summary of the allocation, including an additional "Status" column which does not affect the correctness of the answer.
