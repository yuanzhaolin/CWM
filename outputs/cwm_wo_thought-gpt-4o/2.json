Here's what I found:\n\n| Order ID | Status       |\n|----------|--------------|\n| 2        | Completed    |\n| 10       | Not Completed|\n\nSo, it seems like not all of John's orders have been completed. Order ID 2 is all set, but Order ID 10 still needs some work. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask! 😊",
