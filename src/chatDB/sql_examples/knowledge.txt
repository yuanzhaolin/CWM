## Definition of the progress of an order
The total completed quantity of all sewing tasks corresponding to the products in an order, divided by the total quantity of products in an order.

## Hint of creating cutting tasks
If cutting tasks are not created using tools, it is necessary to retrieve the types and quantities of wip materials required for producing a product. Then, calculate the total demand for each type of wip material and create the cutting tasks accordingly.

## Requirement
When you are asked to create a new order, the default order name is "Order" + the current date and time. For example, if the current date and time is 2021-07-01 12:00:00, the default order name is "Order20210701120000".
