Step5: Insert the cutting tasks for "Master Cutters" and "Professional Cutters"

INSERT INTO cutting_tasks (id, start_time, end_time, working_group_id, order_product_id, planned_number, is_started) VALUES (UUID(), CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, DATE_ADD(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, INTERVAL 30 DAY), '<master_cutters_id>', '<order_product_id>', <half_number>, TRUE);
Execute:
INSERT INTO cutting_tasks (id, start_time, end_time, working_group_id, order_product_id, planned_number, completed_number, is_started)
 VALUES (UUID(), CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, DATE_ADD(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, INTERVAL 30 DAY), 'wg3', 'op12', 75, 0, FALSE),
        (UUID(), CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, DATE_ADD(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, INTERVAL 30 DAY), 'wg5', 'op12', 75, 0, FALSE);

Step6: Insert the sewing task for "Elite Sewers"

INSERT INTO sewing_tasks (id, start_time, end_time, working_group_id, order_product_id, planned_number, is_started) VALUES (UUID(), CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, DATE_ADD(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, INTERVAL 60 DAY), '<elite_sewers_id>', '<order_product_id>', <total_number>, TRUE);
Execute:
INSERT INTO sewing_tasks (id, start_time, end_time, working_group_id, order_product_id, planned_number, is_started) VALUES (UUID(), CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, DATE_ADD(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, INTERVAL 60 DAY), 'wg10', 'op12', 150, FALSE);
